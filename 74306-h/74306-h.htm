PREFACE.
</p>

<p>
The Authoress of the following tale has often
said that she has devoted her pen to her
adopted country, India.  Has she then changed her
purpose in again writing a story for British readers?
No; though in a different way, she is still seeking to
serve the Missionary cause.  A.L.O.E. wants money
for her "Mission Plough," a School for Mohammedan
and heathen boys in Batala, and it occurred to her
that hours, not taken from her city work, might be
given to earning something by literary effort.
</p>

<p>
The School which A.L.O.E. thus attempts to prop
up by her quill, sprang out of a felt want.  Native
boys were willing to hear the Gospel, and in the
Government School were taught no religion at all.
The Missionary Society to which A.L.O.E. belongs,
restricts its attention to women and girls; of course
not a penny could be taken from its funds for boys,
though teaching them indirectly helps the Zenana
work&mdash;the seed of truth being sometimes carried
by them to the very strongholds of feminine bigotry.
</p>

<p>
Thus the "Mission Plough" is supported by no
society; the expenses are to be met by personal effort,
or the assistance of those who sympathise with its
object.  A.L.O.E  most gratefully acknowledges the
great liberality with which kind friends have come to
her aid.  May the Lord reward them a thousandfold
for what they have done!

<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br><br>
NEWS FROM ENGLAND.
</h3>

<p>
"The post-dák at last!" exclaimed Walter
Gurney, springing to his feet, as,
encompassed by a cloud of dust, the vehicle for
which he had been watching appeared in the
distance, the flourish of a horn announcing its
approach.  The youth had been reclining under
the shade of a peepul tree, at the side of the road
which led to a frontier station on the border line
which divides India from the land of the Afghans.
The post had always to be met at this point by
Walter, as the horses were never turned down the
rude road which led to a missionary's bungalow,
situated about two miles off, almost close to a
native village.  The Rev. William Gurney, till his
death, which had occurred about two months ere my
story opens, had always dwelt amongst his poor flock,
"the world forgetting, by the world forgot."  The
missionary's sole companion had been Walter, his
only son, whom he had himself educated in India,
the neighbourhood of mountains preventing the
absolute necessity of his sending his motherless
boy to England.
</p>

<p>
This was the third time that Walter had
anxiously gone to meet the home mail.  By his
dying father's desire he had remained at Santgunge
till he should receive a letter from his grandmother
in London, in answer to the announcement of the
missionary's death.  Walter could not form any
plans for his own future till he should hear from
the nearest relative now left to him upon earth.
</p>

<p>
The expected letter was handed down by the
coachman to Walter, and with another blast of the
horn the dák-gári* rattled on its way.  Walter
returned to the peepul tree, and, leaning against its
trunk, examined the envelope of the letter before
opening it to read the contents.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Post-cart or carriage.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Black-edged, but not written in my grandmother's
hand.  She must have been ill, which
would account for her not writing before.  The
news which I sent must have grieved her sorely."
</p>

<p>
Walter broke open the letter and glanced at the
signature at the end; it was that of his uncle,
whose handwriting was strange to the youth.
Augustus Gurney, the wealthy banker, had never
cared to keep up intercourse with a brother who
had demeaned himself, as he thought, by becoming a
humble missionary.  The stiff, formal, business-like
writing was characteristic of him who had penned
it.  The letter was dated from Eaton Square, 1871.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"DEAR WALTER,&mdash;The melancholy announcement
of your father's decease never reached your
grandmother; it arrived on the day of her funeral.
I have delayed writing till all affairs were settled.
You asked for directions for your future course, and
whether there were any means of your finishing your
education in some college in England.  You shall
receive a frank reply.  My mother's income being
only a life annuity, ceased at her death; she had no
property to leave.  There are no funds available to
pay your passage home or start you in life.  Every
profession here is overcrowded.  You must not look
to me, as I have three sous to provide for, and I
never approved of the course which your father
chose to take.  You had better try to find some
employment in India.  Doubtless you have there
plenty of friends; here you would be amongst
strangers.&mdash;Your affectionate uncle,
</p>

<p class="noindent">
AUGUSTUS GURNEY."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Strangers indeed," muttered Walter between
his clenched teeth.  "Can this man, I will not call
him uncle, actually receive the news of the death
of his only brother, a brother whom he always
neglected, a brother of whom he should have been
proud, without so much as a feeling of remorse, or
one word of sympathy to his orphan?  He does
not wish to be burdened with a poor relation!
He shall certainly never be troubled by me!"  Walter
crushed up the letter in his bands, and
with long rapid strides took his way along the
rough, weed-overgrown path which led to his
desolate home.  Bitter were the orphan youth's
reflections.
</p>

<p>
"'Doubtless you have plenty of friends,'" he
writes.  "Did my uncle know nothing of the
isolated life of self-denial led by my father amongst
our ignorant peasants?  I have seen nothing of
the world; know no one to take me by the hand.
Though I have a passion for study, I have not
received the educational advantages that would fit
me for Government employment.  I have led a
kind of Robinson Crusoe life; I can shoot, can turn
a straight furrow, ride, plant trees, and do a little
carpenter's work; talk to natives of India or
Afghanistan in half-a-dozen jargons; but I know
little of mathematics, am only self-taught in Latin;
I could pass no examination,&mdash;at least I doubt that
I could,&mdash;and I have no funds to support me till I
could study up for one.  I changed my last rupee
to-day."
</p>

<p>
It may be little to the credit of Walter that
indignation towards his uncle and anxiety about
his own future were the first thoughts that came
into his mind on learning of the death of his aged
relative in England.  But Walter, brought up in the
wilds of Santgunge, had never seen his grandmother
nor received any letter from her.  Once a-month
an epistle from the old lady had regularly reached
her missionary son, with a brief message to his boy
at the end.  Before Walter reached his home,
more gentle feelings prevailed.  He could feel
thankful that parent and son had both been spared
the pang of bereavement which had wrung his own
heart.  Walter thought of the joyful surprise of
the meeting above of those who for twenty years
had been severed on earth.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, a time will come when we shall care little
whether our path was rough or smooth on earth;
whether it led upwards to distinction, or downwards
to poverty and trouble," said Walter to himself, as
he entered the little bungalow in which he had
dwelt from his birth.  It was a most unadorned
dwelling, built chiefly of sun-dried bricks, and by
no means in good repair, for the rains had injured
the walls, and white ants eaten into the timber.
The interior matched the outside; a few prints and
texts, with an old brown map, were the only
ornaments; the rough mat on the brick floor had been
worn into holes by the tread of many bare feet.  A
few chairs and a table, a bookcase and its contents,
chiefly religious books, reports, and Urdu
pamphlets, summed up the furniture of the room which
Walter entered.  The youth's own appearance was
in character with his surroundings.  His clothes,
originally of common material, were worn almost
threadbare.  Walter was tall and slight, and the
first impression which a stranger would receive was
that he was overgrown and underfed.  Though his
age was barely seventeen, there were signs of care on
his countenance, and a sunken look under his eyes
that told of months of night watching and daily
hardship.  Yet a second glance at his form, and
the broad expansive brow from which the weary lad
now pushed back the wavy auburn hair, might
suggest a presage that after a few years the figure
might be remarkably fine, the countenance singularly
intellectual.
</p>

<p>
Walter threw himself on a chair.  Raising his
eyes, their glance rested on a picture with
time-stained margin, which had been familiar to him
from his earliest childhood.  The youth's almost
sole recollection of his mother was her explaining
the meaning of the print to her little boy, then
young enough to be raised in her arms.  The print
represented the Israelites encamped at night in the
desert, their tents made visible by the light streaming
from the pillar of fire before them.  That print
had been, as it were, the text of the last exhortation
which Walter had heard from his father, which
vividly now recurred to the mind of the desolate
youth.
</p>

<p>
"God may lead us into the desert, my boy, but
it is a blessed way if His presence go with us.  The
eye of faith still sees the pillar of cloud and fire to
guide us wherever God wills we should go, and we
are safe&mdash;ay, and happy&mdash;as long as we follow the
path marked out by Him who is all wisdom and
love."
</p>

<p>
"The pillar has for me long rested over this
place," said Walter to himself; "I would not have
left my father, with his broken health, to struggle
on alone.  But now the pillar will move on,&mdash;I
wonder whither!  I had hoped to England&mdash;and
Cambridge&mdash;with future honour and usefulness
beyond.  That letter has dashed down all my
air-built castles!  The desert around me looks very
bare; but O my God!&mdash;my father's God! do
Thou guide me, and give me grace and courage to
follow on, nor turn aside to the right or the left."
</p>

<p>
Walter knelt down in his desolate home, and in
a short but fervent prayer commended himself to
the guardian care of a Saviour God.  He arose
from his knees cheered and refreshed.  Walter
then applied himself to the homely care of preparing
his evening meal, for, soon after his father's
death, he had dismissed his only servant.  Some of
the native flock would willingly have worked for the
missionary's son, without hope of payment beyond
that of a kind look and word, but their offers had
been declined with grateful thanks by the orphan.
</p>

<p>
Walter's gun had on this day supplied him with
a more sumptuous repast than usually fell to his
lot; but he had emptied his powder-flask for the
charge which had brought down his pheasant, and
had no means of filling it again.  The youth, as he
plucked off the beautiful feathers of his prize, saw
in their loveliness a pledge that He who had so
clothed the bird of the jungle would not leave His
child uncared for.  Walter had to light his fire, and
cook his food, as well as provide it.  His kitchen
was the open air; his oven&mdash;native fashion&mdash;was
formed of dried mud, and was of the simplest
construction.  The apparatus comprised merely a few
brass vessels, and an iron plate for cooking
<i>chapatties</i>.*  While the pheasant was being stewed,
Walter proceeded to prepare this simple substitute
for the bread, which was a rare luxury in Santgunge.
Skilled as he was by practice, round balls of dough
in Walter's hand were successively patted out and
flattened, then spread on the heated iron and turned,
till a nicely browned chapattie was ready.  Walter,
engaged in his humble occupation, and absorbed in
thoughts quite unconnected with chapatties, did not
notice the sound of a horse's hoofs, and was rather
startled by the loud voice of its rider, which
suddenly broke on the silence.

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br><br>
A SUDDEN CHANGE.
</h3>

<p>
"Koi hai? any one there?" the usual
summons to a servant in India, brought
Walter to his feet.  Turning, he saw in
the horseman, splendidly mounted, who appeared
before him, a gentleman whom he had only once
met before, about three months previously, but
whom he instantly recognised.  Walter would have
done so had thrice as many years intervened since
the meeting.
</p>

<p>
For Dermot Denis was not one to be quickly
forgotten.  He was upwards of six feet in height, and
with form graceful as well as powerfully built.  A
quantity of thick curly hair, of a tint that might be
called golden, surmounted an intelligent face, both
handsome and pleasant, whose grey eyes sparkled
with life and fun.  Walter had, as has been
mentioned, seen Denis but once before; but it was under
circumstances that had made a deep impression on
his mind.
</p>

<p>
It had been a time of great trouble amongst the
native Christians of Santgunge.  Their crops had
utterly failed.  Their missionary was sinking under
a slow and painful disease.  Mr. Gurney, who felt
the trials of his people more than his own, desired
Walter to pay a visit to an official at the nearest
station, which was fifteen miles away, to try to
induce him to give some relief.  It was a commission
distasteful to the youth.  He disliked playing the
beggar, and had no faith in his own powers of
persuasion.  It was shyly that he told his father's
message to the official, whom he found entertaining
the handsome Irishman.
</p>

<p>
"I wish I could do more for your people," said
the official, placing five rupees on the table; then,
as if changing the subject, he turned and said, "Let
me introduce you to Mr. Dermot Denis, an Irish
gentleman, who, having more time and money on
his hands than he knows what to make of, has come
to India in search of adventures.  Mr. Denis, this
is the son of a missionary who, for twenty years, in
a desolate jungle, has devoted his life to attempts
to convert the natives."
</p>

<p>
The cordial shake of the young Irishman's hand
which followed this introduction was gratifying to
Walter, and still more so was the currency note for
a hundred rupees which was frankly and pleasantly
given.  Walter could hardly utter a word of thanks,
but his heart felt deeply grateful.  Joyfully he bore
back the large contribution, which his sick father
received almost with tears, as a gift from heaven.
</p>

<p>
"God bless the generous donor!" he faltered.
</p>

<p>
"O father!  I wish that you could have seen
him!" exclaimed Walter, with the enthusiasm of
youth.  "I never met with any one like him, he
looked so bright and brave!  How noble he must
be in whom wealth and position have raised no
pride, one who gives without being asked, and in a
manner so frank and kind!"
</p>

<p>
The parting words of Denis to Walter had been,
"I'll some day invade you in your jungle, and see
the fruits of your good father's attempts to
manufacture monkeys into men."
</p>

<p>
And now the Irishman had kept his promise.
Walter eagerly went forward to meet him, wrung
his hand warmly, and in few words told him of the
heavy loss which he himself had sustained.
</p>

<p>
"And you're here all alone!" exclaimed Denis,
as he dismounted; "just call your <i>sais</i> (<i>groom</i>);
my man has fallen desperately ill on the road&mdash;I
had to leave him behind."
</p>

<p>
"I am my own <i>sais</i>, and will be yours," said
Walter, laying his hand on the horse's bridle to lead
it away.
</p>

<p>
"Groom and cook too? you're a clever fellow!"
cried Denis, gaily.  "I'm glad that I've caught you
just at dinner-time, for I'm desperately hungry.
Just returned from a long expedition, riding day
and night from dawn to sunset.  I'll just turn into
the house and have a smoke, whilst you look after
the bay."
</p>

<p>
Even had Walter had no reason to feel grateful
towards Denis, he was much too hospitable to
grudge the stranger a share of the dinner which
was to have lasted himself for two meals, though
he had had nothing but chapatties on the previous
day, and it was doubtful when he would again be
able to procure anything more substantial.
</p>

<p>
When Walter re-entered the dwelling, carrying
with him the stewed pheasant and chapatties, he
found his guest seated at his ease on a chair, with
his feet on the table, smoking.  Denis threw away
his cigar, put down his feet, and applied himself
with vigour to the occupation of eating his dinner,
demolishing more than two-thirds of the pheasant,
whilst talking all the time.
</p>

<p>
"A most unlucky chance for me, my fellow's
falling ill!" he exclaimed.  "He was a regular
brick; could jabber several languages, was clever at
everything&mdash;of course cheating his master included.
I daresay that he shammed sickness, because he had
no fancy to go where I am going.  How to supply
his place I know not.  By-the-by, do you happen
to know anything of Pushtoo?"*
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* The language of the Afghans.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"I know it pretty well," replied Walter, who
was a very good linguist; "Afghans frequently pass
this way; we have had one here for weeks who has
just recovered from a troublesome illness, and is
going back to his home.  He is a Kandahar man."
</p>

<p>
"A Kandahar man!" exclaimed Denis eagerly.
"That's just what I wanted.  Do you think that
he would act as my guide into Afghanistan?"
</p>

<p>
"You do not mean that you think of crossing
the border?" said Walter in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Cross it? yes, and go a great way beyond it&mdash;as
far as Kandahar, possibly to Kabul; I have a great
object before me," said Denis, mysteriously lowering
his voice.
</p>

<p>
"You are hardly aware of the danger&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Danger!" interrupted Denis, "I revel in
danger.  I know that the Afghans, every mother's
son of them, are thieves and cut-throats; they slice
off your head, and then&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And then?" said Walter, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"You have something to put into a book."
</p>

<p>
Walter could not help laughing at the Hibernian's
bull; but resuming his grave expression he
observed, "I do not think that you fully know
what you would undertake."
</p>

<p>
"I know everything!" cried Denis, a little
impatiently; "I've had it all dunned into me by
every one whom I've met, but all I've heard only
strengthens my resolution to go.  I'm sick of
travelling about in a place like India, where every
black fellow salams you, and vows he's your slave.
I've done India thoroughly all round; seen all that's
to be seen, and much more.  I've visited no end of
Hindu mosques and Mohammedan temples, have
dined with the Viceroy, and taken pot-luck with
the Brahmins.  Now I want something new and
exciting.  Besides, as I told you, I've an object in
view.  I'm going, if all the world should cry
'stay.'"  And with a look of stern determination,
Denis finished off the last bit of the pheasant.
</p>

<p>
Then followed a few seconds of silence.  It was
broken by Denis exclaiming, with the joyousness
inspired by a happy thought: "I say, Walter,
you will come with me!  You know the language,
you have made friends with the Afghans; having
you with me would increase a thousandfold my chance
of getting back with a whole skin.  You're a good
shot, I suppose?"&mdash;he glanced at a gun in a corner.
</p>

<p>
"Fair," replied Walter Gurney, who hardly ever
missed his aim.
</p>

<p>
"You have a horse, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"A hill-pony,&mdash;not much of a mount."
</p>

<p>
"But, doubtless, he can keep his legs on the
mountains; you're not such a weight as I am,
though pretty nearly as tall.  Yes, yes, you're just
the companion I wanted; a jovial young chap, sticking
at nothing, who can ride, shoot, cook, groom a
horse, and I daresay shoe it at a pinch, and who
will think no more of danger than I do."
</p>

<p>
The blood mantled on Walter's cheek; he was
young, and his heart beat high at the thought of
adventures; besides, he knew that it was true that
his knowledge of Afghan character, customs, and
language, might possibly be the means of even
saving the life of his imprudent friend, who scarcely
opened his lips without making a blunder.  Denis
saw Walter's look of hesitation, and eagerly pushed
his advantage.
</p>

<p>
"We'll strike a fair bargain!" the Irishman
cried.  "You go with me for one or two months, and
I'll take you back with me to England.  You're
poor&mdash;there's no disgrace in that; I happen to have a full
purse; I'll share with you as if you were my brother.
I'll see to your education, and start you in life; you
shall never know a want whilst Dermot Denis has a
sovereign left.  It's a bargain!  Give me your hand
on it, old boy!"  And Denis stretched out his own.
</p>

<p>
How rapidly thoughts fly through the mind&mdash;more
rapidly than fingers can trace them!  "Is
not this an answer to my prayer?" thought Walter.
"A few minutes ago I felt, as regards earth, friendless,
penniless, desolate!  At once, how unexpectedly
a friend and the means of future independence are
given me!  If I risk something, is it not for a
hero, a benefactor, one who has shown me kindness
unsought!  Then the journey itself may be an
opening for good.  My father often expressed hopes
that a day might come when mission-work might
be pushed on beyond the frontier&mdash;the Afghans
were frequently in his prayers.  May I not hope
to carry the Gospel to some of the wild people of
the mountains, several of whom have enjoyed the
hospitality of my parent, and received some instruction
from his lips.  I believe that my 'fiery cloudy
pillar' is moving towards the hills."
</p>

<p>
"How long will you keep me with my hand
stretched out like a sign-post, waiting till you come
to a decision which I see that you have jumped at
already?" the Irishman cried.
</p>

<p>
Walter grasped the strong, sun-burnt hand.  The
silent bargain was concluded; no signed and sealed
bond could have made it more firm, at least as
regarded the missionary's son.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br><br>
GILDING RUBS OFF.
</h3>

<p>
An interruption now occurred in the arrival of
two large heavily-laden mules with their
drivers.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, there comes my luggage at last!" exclaimed
Denis, jumping up from his seat, and going
forth to meet them.  "I hope, Walter, that your
goods and chattels will pack into the very smallest
dimensions, for as my beasts have as much as they
can bear, they can't well carry very much more."
</p>

<p>
"A case of 'The last feather breaks the camel's
back,'" observed Walter.
</p>

<p>
"I never could make out the sense of that
proverb," said the Irishman.  "I'd put the last
feather first, and the camel would not so much as
feel it."
</p>

<p>
Walter glanced at the speaker to see if he
were in jest or earnest; but Denis's handsome face
betrayed no consciousness that he had been talking
nonsense.
</p>

<p>
"My pony," said young Gurney, "can carry the
few things which I shall require; I shall walk, and
lead it."
</p>

<p>
Dermot Denis was busy with one of his trunks
which had been removed from the mule and placed
on the ground.  He extracted from it a corkscrew
and a bottle of brandy, and with these returned to
the house, followed by Walter.
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad that the rascals brought the mules in
time," said the Irishman, seating himself, and applying
the screw to the cork.  "You and I must finish
our dinner with a 'dhrop of the cratur,' as my
countrymen say."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks; but I never taste wine or spirits."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, nonsense; if you've never done it yet, you
must do it now, if only for good fellowship.  You've
not been ass enough to take the pledge, I suppose?"  Denis
had the bottle between his knees, and out
came the cork.
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me for two minutes," said Walter, and
he went hastily into the inner apartment.  There
on a table lay his Bible, his desk, and a few
scattered papers and books.
</p>

<p>
"Here is a new danger," said Walter to himself.
"I had better do at once what I have often thought
of doing."  He opened his Bible, dipped his pen,
and in a firm bold hand wrote on the fly-leaf, "I
declare that I will never, except by medical advice
or at communion, let a drop of alcohol pass my
lips."  Walter signed the declaration, added the
date, and returned to the room where Denis was
mixing his brandy and water.  The Irishman
pushed the bottle towards him.  "I have taken a
pledge," said Walter.
</p>

<p>
"When did you take it?"
</p>

<p>
"I took it just now."
</p>

<p>
Denis gave a little whistle of surprise.  Walter
had made up his mind that his friend would be
angry at opposition from one so much his inferior
in age and position; but the frank face of Denis
did not look angry, it had only an expression of
half-contemptuous pity, which was to Walter harder
to bear.  No man, especially a very young one,
likes to be thought weak-minded by the companion
to whom he looks up.  It was the doubt how he
himself could bear perpetually to oppose himself to
the wishes of his benefactor that had made Walter
take the decided step of signing the pledge.  "Well,
you're the loser, I'm the gainer, for my liquor will
last the longer," said Denis, raising his glass to his
lips.  "But," he observed, as he set it down empty,
"if you fancy that you will curry favour with the
Mohammedans by giving way to their nonsensical
prejudices regarding wines, you'll find that you
are greatly mistaken.  They don't follow their
Vedas* at all."  (Denis, it appears, did not know
any difference between the Vedas and the Koran.)  "The
Mohammedan drinks on the sly.  He sits on
his carpet spread on the floor, with his brandy-bottle
in one hand and his hookah in the other, and
drinks till he rolls under the table."  Denis spoke
authoritatively, as one who knows a great deal
more about Eastern habits than a youth who had
spent all his years in India.  Walter did not care
to contradict him.  Half-an-hour before Denis had
been a hero in his eyes; the gilded image of a
chivalrous knight was already losing a little of its brightness.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Now, take me to your Kandahar man; I'll
strike my bargain at once.  He shall guide us
through the Afghan passes."
</p>

<p>
Walter led the way into the native village, which
was not many steps distant from what had been
the home of the pastor.  It was much like other
villages in India&mdash;a congregation of mud-huts, with
not a pane of glass to be seen, but was somewhat
cleaner than those of the heathen.  One small,
neat building of brick, with a bell hung aloft,
showed that it possessed a place for Christian
worship.  Swarthy natives came out of what Denis
called their ant-hill; women stood in the doorways,
to stare at the unwonted sight of a European
stranger.  There were swarms of children of both
sexes and all ages, who received many a kind word
from Walter as they stood smiling and salaming.
</p>

<p>
"Fancy passing all one's life among such as
these!" exclaimed Denis, shrugging his shoulders.
"Do you dignify these bare-footed blackies by the
name of Christians?"
</p>

<p>
"My father has baptised more than forty,"
replied Walter, "but the majority&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Where's the Kandahar fellow?" asked Denis,
who had no taste for anything like a missionary
report.
</p>

<p>
Walter led the way into a mud-built dwelling.
The Irishman did not stoop his tall form sufficiently
to avoid knocking his head as he entered, and in
the semi-darkness stumbled over a recumbent calf
which shared the dwelling.  Hanif, the Afghan,
wrapped in a blanket, was lying on his <i>charpai</i>.*
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Native bedstead.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Conversation was at once entered upon by Denis,
Walter acting as his interpreter.  The Afghan
looked astonished at the opening sentences, and
burst forth into rapid, excited utterances.
</p>

<p>
"What on earth is the fellow saying?" asked
Denis with impatience.
</p>

<p>
"He is vowing by his Prophet's beard that he
will not undertake to guide you; that the Feringhee*
must be mad to think of crossing the frontier.
Hanif declares that if you did reach Kandahar
by his means, he would be bastinadoed, or lose his
hand or his head; and that if you were murdered
on the way, the Feringhees would insist on his
being hanged, however innocent he might be.
Really," said Walter, in a tone of expostulation, "I
think that there is some reason in what the man
says.  I wish that you would turn your thoughts in
some other direction."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Natives call Europeans Feringhees.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Give your advice when it's asked for," said
Denis, pettishly.  "If you're afraid to accompany
me, I let you off your agreement.  You may stay
and vegetate here amongst your niggers."
</p>

<p>
"I am not afraid," commenced Walter, who was
a good deal nettled; "but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
His new friend cut him short: "Tell the fellow
I'll pay him treble what he could fairly demand.
Afghans would do anything for gold."
</p>

<p>
And so it proved.  Hanif's eyes glistened at
the thought of the large payment offered; and
as the <i>bard sahib</i> (great gentleman) was evidently
so rich, perhaps an idea of helping to relieve him
of some of his goods by the way made the Pathan
less reluctant to run some risk.  Was he not
accustomed to hazard his life for <i>loot</i> (plunder)?
So the bargain was struck; the party were to start
early on the following morning.
</p>

<p>
Denis returned to the house.  Walter remained
to make arrangements with a respectable Christian
native employed as a catechist as to the care of his
own trifling property during his absence.  He gave
him the keys of the dwelling, to which some
missionary might perhaps be sent before long.
</p>

<p>
The little church-bell was rung&mdash;such was the
custom at Santgunge&mdash;to gather the native Christians
for devotions before they retired to rest.  As,
surrounded by simple worshippers, Walter joined in
the praise and the prayer, again he solemnly
devoted himself to his God, before proceeding on
what might prove to be a dangerous journey.  Then,
after exchanging kind words and good wishes with
those who loved him for his father's sake as well
as his own, the missionary's son returned to his
dwelling.
</p>

<p>
Denis, having had his own way, had quite
recovered his temper, and was in exuberant spirits
when Walter joined him.
</p>

<p>
"I wondered how long you were going to leave
me to my own meditations, with no light but that
of my cigar, while you enjoyed the intellectual
conversation of your niggers, so soon to be exchanged
for company so insipid as mine!" he said, laughing,
as Walter entered the room.
</p>

<p>
Young Gurney, by lighting a lamp, soon dispelled
the darkness.  In the gaiety of his heart Denis
drew his chair closer to Walter's, and was inclined
to be quite confidential.
</p>

<p>
"I don't mind telling you, old boy&mdash;for I know
you'll be silent as the grave&mdash;what is my great
object in pushing on beyond the border.  You'll
not breathe a word to a soul alive."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Denis," said Walter, "we are going amongst
Afghans, one of whose characteristics is intense
curiosity.  We shall be questioned and cross-questioned
on every point, and often silence is in
itself a reply."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm a match for Afghans!" cried Denis
lightly; "I can lie like a Persian&mdash;only, unluckily,
I don't know the language they lie in!"
</p>

<p>
"I do know the language, and I cannot lie,"
observed Walter; "therefore I had better be in
ignorance of anything that you wish to remain
concealed."
</p>

<p>
"You mean that ignorance would be bliss to you,
and safety to me!" cried Denis.  "You would not
wilfully let the cat out of the bag, but you could
not help her mewing in it.  Well, be it as you
wish; I will not reveal to you my great object.
But&mdash;oh here's just what I want, a supply of
paper; I've a bottle of ink, and pens, but I quite
forgot the paper!"  Denis's hand was upon about
a quire of letter-sized paper, on the first six or
seven pages of which something had been written,
which he was about to tear off in order to throw
them away.
</p>

<p>
"Hold!" exclaimed Walter hastily, laying his
hand on the Irishman's arm.  "That's valuable;
that's my father's writing,&mdash;a translation of the
Gospel into Pushtoo which he began but never
lived to finish.  You shall have other paper.  I
mean to take this with me," and he put the
manuscript into his bosom.
</p>

<p>
"Now there's one thing I want to say to you,
Walter Gurney," began Dermot Denis, looking his
companion full in the face; "you've been brought
up in the midst of a great deal of religious talk
with all sort of puritanical notions, till I daresay
you think it a deadly sin to look at a bottle, or
dance a polka, or shuffle a pack of cards.  You're
welcome to your thoughts if you keep them to
yourself.  But we're going amongst a pack of rabid
Moslems, and if they come on the subject of religion,
the least contradiction on your part will make
them fly at our throats.  I'm not going to wave a
red flag in the face of a bull.  If the bigots question
me I'll say I'm a philosopher, with no particular
notions; that will save me from all the troublesome
arguments on ticklish subjects that I don't
understand.  And I desire you'll do just the
same."
</p>

<p>
Walter coloured to the roots of his hair, but he
returned with steady firmness the gaze of his
comrade.  "I'll never deny my faith," he said,
laying his clenched hand on the table; "in religious
matters I will be in bondage to no man, and if
God gives me an opportunity of speaking a word for
Him, I can never engage to be silent.  If you do
not accept this condition, sir, it will be impossible
for me to remain your companion."
</p>

<p>
Denis tried to laugh off his annoyance, but there
was more of irony than of mirth in his laugh.
"Hear how the young cock crows!" he cried,
"when hardly out of the shell.  He'll sing a
different note when his feathers are grown.
Good-night, my puritanical friend, I'm going to bed; as
we start to-morrow, I hope that you'll awake in the
morning a wiser and a merrier man."  And taking up
the solitary lamp, Denis retreated into the inner
room, leaving Walter Gurney to darkness and his
own reflections.
</p>

<p>
These reflections were by no means agreeable.  If
the gilded image of a knightly man had before
appeared dimmed to Walter, it was now as if
fragments dropping off from what had seemed like
armour had betrayed the plaster of Paris beneath.
When Walter had grasped the hand of Denis
as a pledge that he would, if needful, follow him
to the death, the Irishman had appeared to him in
the light of a hero, generous, gallant, and noble&mdash;a
Cœur de Lion, Bayard, Sir Philip Sidney in one.
Walter, with boyish enthusiasm,&mdash;for he was little
more than a boy,&mdash;had imagined his handsome
young benefactor, protector, and friend, all that he
desired him to be.  They had now been but a few
hours together, and the youth had already seen
folly, vanity, selfishness, and a want of principle in
his companion.  Walter would fain have recalled
the feelings with which he had welcomed his friend,
and accused himself of ingratitude, fickleness, and
presumption for so quickly altering his opinion of
one whom he still desired to honour, for he still
felt strongly disposed to love him.
</p>

<p>
But Walter's judgment was not now in fault.
He was simply beginning to see Denis as he actually
was.  Not that the bold, dashing traveller was what
the world would regard as a bad man; on the
contrary, he was made to be its favourite.  Brought
up in the atmosphere of a pleasant home, Denis was
addicted to no particular vice.  He was said to bear
a high character, and to be liberal almost to a fault.
Yes, Denis was liberal when to be so cost him no
sacrifice of self-love.  He could throw a sovereign
to a beggar, but he would not have parted with his
last cigar even to his dearest friend.  But Denis
had no very dear friend.  As his judgment was
shallow, so his affections were weak.  He was almost
an exemplification of the witty description of a man
whose heart is the exact size of his coffin&mdash;it can
hold nothing but himself.  Denis's ruling passions
were vanity, selfishness, and an intense thirst for
admiration.  He had had too much of the
last-mentioned sweet poison already, and to imbibe it
seemed a necessity of his nature.  It was this, and
love of excitement which made the young Irishman
undertake dashing adventures.  He would rather
have been talked about for his faults and follies than
not be talked about at all.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br><br>
FAIRLY STARTED.
</h3>

<p>
The two companions shared the single sleeping
apartment in the small house.  Thus Walter
could not but observe that Denis commenced
the day on which a dangerous journey would be begun
without anything like prayer.  It was no small effort
to Walter to bow the knee when he felt that Denis's
eyes were watching his movements, and that the
gay adventurer would be likely to despise the spirit
of devotion which he did not himself possess.
Walter was much disposed to go out into the jungle,
and there&mdash;alone with his God&mdash;pour out his
supplications for his friend as well as himself.  But
conscience told Walter that it was chiefly moral
cowardice that prompted the love of solitude.  He
remembered, that thrown closely together as he and
Denis must be for a considerable length of time, it
was far better to meet the difficulty at once, and
openly show his colours.  After Walter's usual reading
of the Scriptures, he therefore knelt down, and
in silent but earnest supplication committed himself
to his Heavenly Guide.  The youth confessed his
own weakness, and asked for strength, for grace
never to be ashamed of his religion, whether in the
presence of those who might mock, or those who
might threaten.  The missionary's son rose with a
spirit refreshed.  Denis had left the apartment.
Walter knew not how his comrade regarded his
conduct.  If he could have read the mind of Denis he
would have seen there a feeling of slight annoyance,
for if anything can make a worldly man's conscience
uneasy, it is the contrast between his own carelessness
and the earnestness of another.  But Denis
had not at all a troublesome conscience&mdash;it scarcely
ever gave token of its existence.  The Hibernian
thought exceedingly well of himself.  One thing on
which he prided himself was his tolerance; he
extended it so widely that it embraced every form
of spiritual error, and made him yield a little
indulgence even to the devotion of what he would call a
narrow-minded puritan like Walter Gurney.
</p>

<p>
When Walter went forth, he found his companion
giving directions in most imperfect Urdu to the
mule-drivers.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, come here and make these stupid fellows
understand me," cried Denis; "they've no more
brains than the beasts that they lead."
</p>

<p>
A few intelligible words from Walter soon made
matters clear.  "Are we to start at once,
Mr. Denis?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't 'Mister' me, as Rob Roy said," cried
the Hibernian, in his frank, pleasant tone.  "We're
sworn brothers in the field; you're Walter, and I
Dermot Denis."
</p>

<p>
When Walter saw the young Irishman again,
mounted on his beautiful steed, in the pride of
his manly strength, the breeze playing with the
golden locks which curled beneath his white
helmet-shaped <i>topi</i>* and the picturesque folds of muslin
which enwreathed it, again the feeling of admiration
came back to the heart of the youth like a tide
that had but ebbed for a while.  Denis, fearless in
heart and buoyant in spirit, appeared again as the
<i>preux chevalier</i>, the bravest of the brave.
</p>

&quot;Denis talked of the voyage to England, and Walter's heart leaped<br>
at the thought of being 'on the blue waters of the boundless sea.'&quot;
</p>

<p>
Walter felt leaving his childhood's home, with
its dear though mournful recollections, and the
native friends who had known him from his birth.
With simple affection they crowded around to bid
him farewell, and invoke blessings on the missionary's
son.  It was not till he had left the villagers
behind that sadness in Walter's breast gave place to
emotions more natural to youth.  Then came a
rebound from the long depressing influence of
sorrow and care&mdash;a sense of freedom, a joyousness of
hope.  Few but have known the keen enjoyment
of starting on a journey with a lively, amusing
companion, and some have experienced the added
zest which a little difficulty or even peril bestows.
There are those to whom
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "If a path be dangerous known,<br>
  The danger's self is lure alone."<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
This was eminently the case with the light-hearted
Hibernian; and Walter shared the pleasant
excitement.  Then the future, which had been so dark
before, shone out glittering before him like the
snow-capped mountains in front.  Denis talked of
the voyage to England, and Walter's heart leaped
at the thought of being, for the first time in his
life, "on the blue waters of the boundless sea."  He
had often longed to hear the dash of the ocean
waves, and inhale the briny breezes.  England, too,
was in prospect.  The youth intensely desired to
behold the mother-land.  He had often pictured to
himself the white cliffs of Albion, and awoke with
a sigh from' day-dreams of success in a college
career.  Now things that, not twenty-four hours
before, had seemed well-nigh impossible of attainment,
appeared to eager hope to have come almost
within reach of his grasp.
</p>

<p>
The grand scenery through which Walter was
passing, the lively conversation of Denis when he
could sufficiently curb his own patience and that of
his horse to accommodate its pace to a walk,
combined to make that morning march one of the
bright spots in the life of young Gurney.  When,
on passing the frontier, Denis put spurs to his steed,
and waving his right arm, shouted "Afghanistan at
last!" his companion caught the infection of his
exultation, and nothing for the time seemed more
enjoyable than this wild foray into a dangerous land.
A noonday halt was needed, both on account of
the heat and the weariness of men and beasts.
Denis selected a charming spot under the shadow
of a high rock for the travellers' bivouac.  A
sparkling streamlet, dancing over pebbles, supplied
the means of both bathing and relieving thirst.
The tired mules were unloaded, saddles and bridles
were removed from horse and pony; the animals
were tethered and allowed to crop the herbage
around them, after their thirst had been slaked.
</p>

<p>
One of the trunks was opened, and gave ample
proof of Denis's skill in providing for travelling
comfort.  There was a store of small tin canisters
containing a variety of articles of food, some of
them unknown even by name to the missionary's
son.  Truffles, turtles, oysters, anchovies, potted
game, tongues, and pickles, gave a choice of
delicacies to Walter, only perplexing by its
abundance.  He quickly prepared a meal, while Denis,
stretched on the ground, amused himself by writing
notes of his journey, or refreshed himself with a
cigar.
</p>

<p>
"I say, who are these advancing?" he playfully
cried, as a party of Afghan women carrying baskets
of fruit appeared descending the road; "not very
formidable opponents, I guess, nor carrying very
terrible weapons.  Walter, are you prepared for a
<i>charge</i>!"
</p>

<p>
The women stopped to stare at the Feringhee
strangers.  Denis hardly needed an interpreter; he
held up a bag and jingled rupees, then signed to
the women to put down their baskets, and pointed
significantly towards his own mouth.
</p>

<p>
"I'm getting on with the language bravely!"
Denis gaily cried.  "Walter, these women
understand my questions without my speaking a
word."
</p>

<p>
The baskets were quickly emptied of the fruit
for which Kabul is famous.  Denis, notwithstanding
his companion's remonstrances, paid for his
purchases a price which astonished the Afghans.
</p>

<p>
"Some great Feringhee lord!" they remarked to
each other.
</p>

<p>
The dinner was by this time ready.  "Let's set
to!" cried Denis, whose appetite was keen.
</p>

<p>
Again recurred the difficulty which, trifling as it
may appear, is one that so often meets the
Christian on his first mingling with the world,
that to sensitive minds it becomes a real cross.
Walter had always been accustomed to return
thanks before meals from the time when his mother
had first put his little hands together, and he had
lisped after her the words which his lips could
hardly frame.  So strong had the habit become,
that before dinner on the previous evening Walter
had said grace as a matter of course at his own
board, without even thinking whether his guest
could object.  He knew Denis better now; he had
met the supercilious glance which had been to him
like a sting.  Was there any need to obtrude his
religion on one who could not understand it?  Was
not faith a private matter between a man and his
God?  So whispered the ever-ready Tempter.  But
a few Scripture words recurred to the mind of the
youth&mdash;<i>Let your light shine before men</i>; and with
an effort which cost Walter more than it would
have done to face a real danger, in a low, but
audible voice he said, "Thanks to God for all His
mercies bestowed through Christ our Lord."
</p>

<p>
"He who prepares the meal considers, I suppose,
that he should finish off by saying the grace,"
observed Denis lightly.  "As for me, I never
pretend to be one of your saints."
</p>

<p>
It is remarkable how many men seem to plume
themselves on making no profession of religion, as
if hypocrisy were the only vice to be shunned.
We do not admire a beggar for parading his rags,
and declaring that he does not profess to be rich;
and who is so destitute as he who has no portion in
the world to come!  We do not think the debt of
gratitude to a bountiful father repaid by his son's
openly declaring that he neither loves nor honours
his parent!  Surely those who with self-complacency
avow that they make no profession of religion, and
never pretend to be saints, may be reckoned
amongst such as "glory in their shame."
</p>

<p>
After a long halt, partly passed in sleep, the
march was resumed.  Progress was necessarily slow,
as the mules could not travel fast, and it was
desirable that the party should keep together.
The pass was wild and desolate; little appeared to
denote that travellers ever passed that way, save
here and there the skeleton of bullock or mule.
As the shadows of evening fell, the travellers
noticed that Hanif seemed to be more on the <i>qui
vive</i>.  The eyes of Denis and Walter naturally
followed the direction of the Afghan's, as he glanced
upwards towards the high cliffs which on either
hand bordered the way.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Walter, I'm sure that I caught sight of
two or three heads up yonder&mdash;not those of deer!"
said Denis, bending from his saddle.  "Don't you
see something&mdash;just above the bush yonder?"
</p>

<p>
"I see," replied Walter.  "Don't you know that it
is the nature of vultures to swoop down on their
prey?"  As he spoke about a score of the powerful
birds, napping their huge wings, rose from the carcase
of some animal on which they had been gorging,
disturbed by the travellers' approach.
</p>

<p>
"I have two double-barrelled guns and a brace
of revolvers; I could give account of fourteen
Afghans," said Denis.  "I'll adorn my belt with
the pistols, and a gun would be better in my hand
than on the back of the mule.  You look to the
priming of yours.  We're no dead sheep for the
vultures to prey on."
</p>

<p>
Perhaps on account of the precautions taken, or
the fact that the wild tribes of the mountain were
at the time too much engaged in their internecine
quarrels, to trouble armed travellers, the place for
the night-halt was reached without any interruption,
though not without several alarms.  All the
party were tired, with the exception, perhaps, of
Denis, who had ridden when others had walked.  A
fire was kindled by Hanif; another, at a short
distance, by the muleteers, who were soon engaged
in cooking.  Walter, on whom all travelling
arrangements devolved, lighted a lamp, and looked
after the horse and pony.  None of the beasts were
allowed to stray away from the little encampment.
Grain for the horse had been brought with them by
the travellers.
</p>

<p>
"We'll make Hanif our watchman to-night,"
said Denis, glancing towards the spot where he and
the muleteers, smoking hookahs by their own little
fire, formed a picturesque group.
</p>

<p>
"Never trust an Afghan," replied Walter.
"You and I must play sentinel by turns."
</p>

<p>
"All right," said Denis, taking out his costly
gold watch.  "From ten to four, that will be six
hours between us.  I never care to sit up late when
there's no dancing or fun to keep me alive, so you'll
take the first turn&mdash;and mind you awake me at one."
</p>

<p>
Walter, who had walked during the greater part
of the day, was exceedingly weary when he began
his night-watch, and, long ere it was ended, found
it almost impossible to keep his eyes open.  He
fed the fire, stick by stick, with the wood which he
had made the muleteers collect.  But it had not
been easy to find much fuel, and before midnight
no light was left but that of the small
hurricane-lamp below, and the brilliant stars above.  Walter
thought of the pillar of glory over the camp of
Israel, under whose calm radiance the multitudes
had slept in calm security.  That pillar was but
the visible emblem of the power which was watching
above him now.  In present, as in olden times,
<i>He that keepeth Israel doth not slumber or sleep</i>.
With the thought came calm and restful assurance.
Walter spent much of his time of watch in silent
prayer.
</p>

<p>
At length the hand of the old watch which Mr. Gurney
the missionary had left to his son, pointed
to one.  Walter went to the spot where lay the tall
form of Denis, wrapped in a large luxurious cloak
lined with costly fur.  The youth stooped down,
and tried to rouse the sleeper, first by his voice,
then by his hand.
</p>

<p>
"It is one o'clock; rise, it is your turn now!"
said Walter.
</p>

<p>
The only sound heard in reply was the heavy
breathing of the sleeper.
</p>

<p>
"Come, come, I can't keep awake longer," said
Walter, shaking the Irishman by the shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Just leave me in peace, will you?" was the
growled-out expostulation of the drowsy Denis.
</p>

<p>
"I am too sleepy to play sentinel any longer,"
said Walter.
</p>

<p>
"Another hour&mdash;just another hour; you roused
me from such a delicious dream!" said Denis,
turning on his side.
</p>

<p>
"He rode all day while I trudged on foot,"
thought Walter, as he resumed his weary watch;
"but as I am maintained by his bounty, I suppose
that I must be content to take the lion's&mdash;or rather
the mule's share of the burden."
</p>

<p>
Again and again the youth caught himself nodding.
Never, it seemed to him, had watch-hands
moved so slowly.  The instant that the point of
two was reached, Walter was again at the side of
Denis.

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br><br>
A ROUGH WAY.
</h3>

<p>
"Hold off, or I'll blow your brains out!"
exclaimed Denis, suddenly starting up to a
sitting position, and looking wildly around
him.  "Oh, Walter, is it only you?  I dreamed that
I had half-a-dozen Afghans upon me!&mdash;why, what
is that horrible noise?"
</p>

<p>
"Only the jackals," said Walter drowsily, coiling
himself up in his rug.
</p>

<p>
"Dismal noise&mdash;worse than the screeching of
owls!  One would think that some venerable
grandfather jackal had departed this life, and that
all his descendants had collected together to howl
at his wake."
</p>

<p>
Walter made no observation; he was already asleep.
</p>

<p>
He was roused at daybreak to prepare for the
morning's journey.  The Europeans did not find it
easy to start.  The muleteers were unwilling to go
forwards, and demanded <i>bakhshish</i>,* and leave to
return.  They refused to reload the mules, though
Denis used very strong Hibernian language, which
Walter did not care to translate.  The fiery young
Irishman then used the argument of the stick,
which was for the time more effectual.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* A present.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The mules were laden at last; but scarcely had
the party started before one of the beasts of burden
was found to be lame.  The slowness of progress
had sorely tried the philosophy of Denis on the
previous day; he now became fiercely impatient at
having to curb in his steed to suit a lame mule's
halting pace.
</p>

<p>
"I'd bet anything that sneaking fellow had
something to do with the beast's lameness!" he
exclaimed.  "I'll give him another taste of my cane."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Denis&mdash;Dermot! nothing is gained, everything
hazarded by making enemies of these men!"
cried Walter.  "That poor creature cannot limp
on with its burden; we shall have to leave something behind."
</p>

<p>
"Put the boxes on your pony," suggested Denis;
"your gun, rug, and other light chattels we'll heap
on the top of the other mule's burden, and then
turn this wretched brute adrift."
</p>

<p>
"That arrangement will never do," said Walter,
who had a good deal more common sense than his
older companion.  "My pony could not carry a
mule's burden, and the other animal is overladen
already.  It is absolutely needful to leave
something behind.  We must part with the least
important part of the luggage."
</p>

<p>
Dermot Denis was reluctant to part with anything.
His weapons, of course, must be kept; his
ammunition and provision for man and horse by the
way, his cooking-vessels and cash&mdash;all were necessaries
not to be left behind.  But his choice cigars,
his yellow-backed novels, crockery, glass, and plate,
his looking-glass, dressing-case, brandy and
champagne,&mdash;Denis made a fight for each article, was
pathetic over his <i>eau-de-cologne</i>, and grudged his
box of fine soap.  A great deal of time was
consumed in opening, unpacking, arranging,
rearranging, and trying to force down lids on
overflowing trunks that obstinately refused to be shut.
It was long before the luggage was so readjusted,
that one mule, with some help from the pony,
could carry the needful part of what had been heavy
burdens for two.  More than one trunk had to be
left behind, and a quantity of most heterogeneous
articles strewed the ground&mdash;objects of great interest
to curious spectators.
</p>

<p>
For, by twos and threes, a little crowd of most
inquisitive Afghans had arrived on the spot.
Bejewelled women appeared who had been carrying
burdens&mdash;one, in addition, with a child seated on
her hip, and another led by the hand.  Most
picturesque men, swathed in striped blankets, with
long black hair hanging wildly over Jewish features,
each with a gun in his hand, or a formidable knife
stuck in the scarf which he wore as a belt.  All
looked as if they had never been washed in their
lives, but would have made fine subjects for an
artist.  The articles on the ground were freely
handled; an embroidered smoking-cap found its
place on the head of a little urchin who had no
clothing besides; the silver-topped bottles of the
dressing-case were speedily appropriated, and
vanished somewhere under the blankets.  Denis
was indignant at seeing his property disappearing
under the very eyes of its owner.
</p>

<p>
"Walter, I say, drive these harpies away!" he
exclaimed in an angry tone.
</p>

<p>
"We could not do so without using our weapons,"
replied Walter; "and were blood once shed, our
lives would not be worth a day's purchase.  In
Afghanistan revenge is reckoned as a virtue."
</p>

<p>
"The Sahib had much better return," said one
of the muleteers, who had been from the first most
reluctant to advance.
</p>

<p>
"The Sahib is a great hero,&mdash;the Sahib never
retreats," observed Hanif the Pathan, with a grin.
</p>

<p>
"Don't trust that man&mdash;he's an Afghan; he
would urge you to go on," said Walter, as Denis
looked to him for an explanation of words which, he
could not understand.
</p>

<p>
"I need no urging&mdash;I'm resolved to go on; do
you think me a weak girl to want to go back now?
No, not if I had to go alone."
</p>

<p>
The Afghans not only used their eyes and their
fingers, but they poured forth a volley of questions.
"Who were the travellers? whence had they come? whither
were they going?  Were they merchants? were
their camels behind them? why did they go
without an escort of armed men?"  Such, and
many more, were the interrogations made on all
sides.  Walter had not time to translate half to his
comrade.
</p>

<p>
"Tell them I'm a Feringhee nobleman," cried
Denis, "a great friend of their Khan; that he
expects me, that I bring him rich presents; that
he'll hang any man, woman, or child that dares to
lay a finger on my goods!"&mdash;he snatched his
umbrella from the hand of a boy, and sent him
spinning and howling.  "Tell them that I've lots
of powder and shot, and could bring down a sparrow
half-a-mile off, to say nothing of a thief of an
Afghan!"
</p>

<p>
Walter did not think it necessary to give a literal
translation of the words of his angry companion;
what he did say could hardly be heard amidst the
Babel of voices, for Hanif and the muleteers were
all taking on themselves to answer the questions,
which they did, in true Oriental style, with wildest
exaggerations.
</p>

<p>
Some of the tin cases of luxuries were on the
ground, glittering in the sun.  An Afghan seized
on one, perhaps in hopes that the metal was silver,
wrenched it open, then flung it from him with an
exclamation of disgust, and a curse.
</p>

<p>
"Dogs of <i>Kafirs</i>! (unbelievers); they eat the
unclean beast!" he cried, surveying the Europeans
with a look of intense hatred.
</p>

<p>
"If we are to proceed, we had better go at once,"
said Walter to Denis.  The Irishman's quick
temper was as a lighted cigar, and Gurney saw that
those around him were as gunpowder ready for
explosion.
</p>

<p>
"I'm ready to go!" cried Denis fiercely; "but
I should like to kick those fellows all round
first."
</p>

<p>
"It is well that they do not understand you,"
observed Walter Gurney.
</p>

<p>
Denis mounted his horse, which had attracted
many admiring and covetous looks from the
Afghans.  He shouldered his gun with a very
determined expression, and glanced down significantly
at the pistols stuck in his belt.
</p>

<p>
The party then moved on, the unladed mule with
difficulty managing to keep up with the rest.  For
at least a mile the travellers were accompanied by
a most unwelcome escort of Afghans; more would
have come but for the temptation afforded by the
loot which the strangers had left behind.  Denis
had insisted on Hanif's carrying for him his valuable
fur-lined cloak.  At the point where the Europeans
at last parted company with the Afghans, Denis
looked round for Hanif, but neither the guide nor
the cloak were anywhere to be seen!
</p>

<p>
"The villain has robbed me!" Denis exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"One could hardly have expected anything else,"
thought Walter.  Indeed it was rather a matter of
surprise to young Gurney that the remainder of the
day passed without any attempt at attack.  The
road had grown steeper, the cliffs higher; it was at
least impossible here to miss the way, as there was
no visible opening on either side.  Walter felt as if
walking, with his eyes open, into a trap; but even
if retreat were possible, he would not for an instant
entertain the thought of deserting his friend.  The
march took longer than that of the previous day,
but much less ground had been passed over.  Before
sunset men and beasts were thoroughly tired out
(always excepting Denis and his high-mettled steed),
notwithstanding the mid-day rest.
</p>

<p>
Again the party bivouacked, and Walter prepared
the meal, which was eaten almost in silence.  The
mishaps of the day had greatly damped the high
spirits of Denis.
</p>

<p>
"I don't care to lie on the bare earth," he said,
"with nothing to keep off the night dews.  Just
lend me your rug."
</p>

<p>
Walter complied at once with the request,
and parted with the only warm wrap in his possession.
</p>

<p>
The day had been a trying one to the missionary's
son; but he had more steel in his composition
than had his more excitable friend; Walter was less
easily elated than Denis, was less impetuous in
action, but had greater power to endure.
</p>

<p>
Yet Walter felt the need of a brief period of
perfect solitude to compose his troubled mind, and
hold communion for a-while with the invisible world.
No trace of an Afghan was in sight.  The rich red
glow of the setting sun was bathing cliff and
stream, and lighting up with beauty a copse to the
right, a little oasis of green in the wild and sterile
mountain landscape.  This copse formed a tempting
place of retreat; Walter would be within call of his
travelling companion, yet be completely screened
from observation.  He made his way over some
stones and tangled brushwood to the spot, buried
himself in the copse, and then, in a half-reclining
posture, gave himself up to thought.
</p>

<p>
"How mysterious are the dealings of Providence!
When, led by gratitude for past kindness, and hope
of future independence, I linked my fortunes to
those of the only being on earth who seemed willing
and able to help me, I thought that I was following
the guidance of the heavenly pillar.  Yet into what
a desert has it led me!  It were childish folly to
close my eyes to the fact that it is more than
probable that I may never return from this mad
expedition; it is more than possible that my blood
may stain an Afghan dagger, my body feed the
mountain eagles.  What then would become of all
my cherished hopes of following in my father's
steps with (such was my vain presumption) a wider
field for missionary enterprise than was given to
him upon earth.  I would not, I thought, lead so
dull, so monotonous a life; I would acquire knowledge,
distinction, eloquence, that I might devote
every gift to my Master's work, lay every talent at
His feet.  I hoped to become a sharp and polished
instrument to be used for the welfare of men, and
I find myself a kind of travelling servant to a man
who cannot sympathise in my views, cannot understand
my aspirations&mdash;a man whom I seem to have
no power to influence for good!
</p>

<p>
"Shall I then doubt the wisdom of Him whose
guidance I have sought in prayer; shall I think
myself forgotten by my Master even if He let me
perish here?  No!" and Walter raised his eyes to
a light cloud floating above, flushed with the rosy
light of the sun, which was itself hidden from view
by the tall cliff behind which it had set.  "No! though
<i>He slay me, yet will I trust in Him</i>!  I
have seen the child of fortune stripped of some of
the things which he valued; gradually he and I may
have to part with all&mdash;perhaps liberty, possibly life.
But there is that of which no power either of earth
or hell can deprive the Christian; <i>nor life, nor
death, nor things present, nor things to come, can
separate him from the love of Christ Jesus our
Lord.  Let what will come, my best treasure is
safe; the Lord is the strength of my heart and my
portion for ever</i>."

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br><br>
THE MOUNTAIN CHILD.
</h3>

<p>
Walter was startled from his meditations
by a sudden rustling in the bushes,
followed by a cry of pain or terror, not
many yards from the spot where he was reclining.
In an instant he was on his feet; and turning
towards the point whence the sound came, Walter
saw a very large cheetah (leopard), that had sprung
from its covert on an Afghan child, and was trying
to carry her off.  The little girl was struggling and
resisting with all her might, striking at the savage
beast with her small clenched hand, while she
loudly cried out for help.  It was well that help
was near, or the struggle would have been short,
and its fatal issue certain.  Walter had no weapon
in his hand; but unarmed as he was, he dashed
through the brushwood to the rescue of the poor
child.  His short and sudden rush was enough to
alarm the cheetah, which seldom, if ever, attacks a
man.  The wild beast dropped its hold of its prey,
and bounding off, escaped by some unseen outlet
from the copse.
</p>

<p>
Walter went up to the child, and beheld the most
beautiful girl on whom his eyes had ever rested.
Excitement and the effort of the struggle had added
a deeper crimson to her cheeks; her face was scarcely
darker than that of a European.  Large blue eyes,
dilated with fear, fringed with long soft dark lashes,
were raised towards her preserver with an eager
wistful gaze.  The girl's hair, in long rich plaits,
fell over her bright red <i>hurta</i>, and was adorned with
many a silver ornament.  Walter was too well
accustomed to Oriental taste to think the child's
loveliness lessened by the numerous rings which weighed
down her little ears, or even the jewel on one side
of the delicately formed nose.  The child was
evidently no poor man's daughter.
</p>

<p>
The girl did not appear to be seriously injured;
her loose sleeve was very much torn, and a few drops
of blood fell from one of her arms.  The attack and
rescue had been the work of but a few seconds.
</p>

<p>
"You are wounded, my poor lamb!" cried
Walter in the Pushtoo tongue, and drawing out his
handkerchief he tore it into shreds to bind up the
bleeding arm.
</p>

<p>
"Not a lamb&mdash;for I fought it; I struck it!  If
I'd had a dagger I would have killed it!" cried the
girl with a fierceness which seemed strange in one
so young and fair.  "I'm an eagle, for I live in the
Eagle's Nest!"
</p>

<p>
With childlike confidence the little Afghan let
Walter bind up her arm, looking at him with a
curiosity which seemed to overpower every other
emotion.
</p>

<p>
"They say you're a Kafir," she observed; "you're
not a dog of a Kafir, you are brave and you are
kind."
</p>

<p>
"How came you to be in the jungle, my child?"
asked Walter; "I never saw you till you cried
out."
</p>

<p>
The child smiled as she answered: "You did not
see me, nor did you see the cheetah.  Wild beasts
know how to hide, and so does the wild Afghan."
</p>

<p>
"Why did you hide?" asked Walter.
</p>

<p>
"I crept down to see what Kafirs are like.  They
told me that rich white Feringhees were going
through the pass, one riding on a beautiful horse.
I hope that the horse is not yours?" she added in
a tone of inquiry.
</p>

<p>
"No, the horse is not mine," replied Walter.
</p>

<p>
"I am glad of that," said the girl.
</p>

<p>
"And why?" inquired the Englishman.
</p>

<p>
"Because I should not like to loot you."
</p>

<p>
"Ha! a secret let out!" thought Walter.  "Do
you think that poor travellers ought to be looted?"
he said aloud.
</p>

<p>
"No, but <i>rich</i> ones should," was the naive reply.
"My father says there are big boxes all filled with
treasure.  He promised to change my silver bracelets
for gold ones from the Feringhee's spoils."
</p>

<p>
Walter was almost as much amused by the frankness
of the child, as alarmed by the information
which she gave.
</p>

<p>
"What is your name?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Sultána," replied the child, whose queenly
manner suited her name.  "Sometimes my father
calls me his little eagle."
</p>

<p>
"And who is your father, Sultána?"
</p>

<p>
"My father is a bold chief, a <i>bara bahadar</i>
(great hero)," replied the girl proudly.  "His foes all
dread Assad Khan.  When last he came back to
the Eagle's Nest from a foray, I saw that two heads
hung from his saddle-bow."
</p>

<p>
"You did not like to see those ghastly heads? you
turned away?" said the English youth, his soul
revolting from the idea of that beautiful child being
connected with scenes of slaughter.
</p>

<p>
"Why should I turn away?  Afghans like to see
dead foes.  I wish, when I'm old enough, that I
could ride about and fight like the Turkystan
women!"
</p>

<p>
"Now, Sultána, you say that your father is a
chief.  If we travellers came to his fort and asked
for food and shelter, would he not give them?"
asked Walter, who had almost finished his surgical
task."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Assad Khan would kill a sheep; he would
feast the strangers; Afghans are kind to strangers,"
replied the girl.
</p>

<p>
"And your father would send them on their way
in safety?" inquired Walter, who had a personal
interest in the reply to the question.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, they would be safe, till they had gone a
little distance," said Sultána, a smile rising to her
rose-bud lips.
</p>

<p>
"And then?"
</p>

<p>
"Then, if they were rich, he would follow and
loot them; if they fought&mdash;he would kill them."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, what fearful darkness broods over this land!"
thought Walter, "when the very children are trained
to delight in deeds of rapine and blood;" and he
sighed.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you sigh?" said Sultána, more gently,
laying her little hand upon Walter's.  "My father
would not cut off your head.  You saved his little
Eagle.  I like you&mdash;I thank you!" and soft
moisture rose in her large blue eyes as she uttered
the words.
</p>

<p>
"Sultána, you have not thanked Him who sent
me to save you," said Walter, gently caressing the
small, sun-burnt hand.
</p>

<p>
"Who sent you?" exclaimed Sultána, glancing
suspiciously around.
</p>

<p>
"The great God,&mdash;He whom you call Allah."
</p>

<p>
"Did He send you,&mdash;did He speak to you? when? how?"
exclaimed Sultána, in great surprise,
withdrawing her hand as she spoke.
</p>

<p>
"I did not hear His voice with my mortal ears;
and yet, Sultána, I feel sure, quite sure, that He
sent me here to save you.  I came into this jungle
thinking to be quite alone, that I might talk with
God."
</p>

<p>
"How can you talk with Allah?" cried Sultána,
the mystery exciting her curiosity, almost her fear.
</p>

<p>
"I tell him all my troubles," replied Walter; "I
have had many troubles of late, and I thank Allah
for helping me through them.  I shall thank Him
to-night for saving you from the cheetah."
</p>

<p>
"And does Allah answer?" inquired Sultána,
her large eyes fixed inquiringly on the speaker.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but in a way that you cannot understand.
O Sultána, I am so glad that the Lord both hears
me and loves me.  I wish that you too would talk
with God."
</p>

<p>
"The Moullahs don't teach us anything like that,"
observed Sultána; "they teach us to say 'There is
one God, and Mohammed is His prophet.'"  She
repeated this moslem confession of faith with the
enthusiasm with which its very sound seems to
inspire the followers of Islam.  "Is that what you
want me to say?"
</p>

<p>
"No, my child," said Walter, very gently; "I
want you to say such words as these: 'Allah! teach
me to know Thee!  Allah! teach me to love
Thee!'"
</p>

<p>
"Love!" repeated the young Afghan, as if her
mind could scarcely take in an idea so new.  "We
must obey Allah, and fast in the Ramazan (though
my father doesn't), and those who want to be saints
should go and walk round the black stone at Mecca.
But <i>love!</i> why should I love Allah?"
</p>

<p>
"Because He loves you," replied Walter; "I
can tell you, for I <i>know</i> it, what your Moullahs
never have told you, that <i>God is love</i>."
</p>

<p>
At this moment, a peculiar sound, something
like a whistle, was heard from the height above.
Sultána started at the sound.
</p>

<p>
"They've missed me&mdash;they're seeking me!" she
exclaimed, and with the rapidity of a fawn she
sprang away, and disappeared as the cheetah had
done, by some unperceived outlet.
</p>

<p>
It was useless to attempt to follow the child,
especially as the sunset glow had given place to
deepening twilight.  With rapid steps Walter
returned to Denis, whom he found smoking by the
fire.
</p>

<p>
"What on earth were those strange noises that
I heard a little while ago?" asked Denis, taking the
cigar from his lips; "I heard something like a
scramble and a cry, and you shouted from the
thicket yonder, and there was, I think, a crashing
of bushes.  I'd half a mind to come and see what
you were after.  Did you rouse some wild beast from
his lair?"
</p>

<p>
Walter gave a short account of Sultána's adventure,
to which Denis listened with keen interest,
bursting into laughter when he heard of the little
maiden's intended appropriation of his horse; it
was a very brief laugh, however, and by no means
one of unmingled mirth.
</p>

<p>
"And now, Dermot, you see that we are watched,
waylaid, that we shall certainly be attacked and
robbed by these fierce mountaineers; you must
resolve at once on what course to pursue."
</p>

<p>
"Sell my life as dearly as I can," muttered
Denis, grasping one of his pistols.
</p>

<p>
"No; mount your horse, your good fleet horse,
and make your way back with all speed, under the
cover of night.  Your animal is not knocked up
like ours.  He may at least bear you far enough to
place you beyond immediate pursuit.  You must of
course abandon your property, and it may serve to
satisfy for a time the rapacity of these wolves.  I
do not think that the muleteers, who will not
attempt to fight, run any serious risk; they will
merely lose the beasts.  But you&mdash;you must not
delay for an hour your escape back to India."
</p>

<p>
"Escape back to India!" exclaimed Denis,
indignantly starting to his feet.  "What do you
take me for, boy?  Do you think that I, Dermot
Denis, am the man to run off from the shadow of
danger like a cur that flies yelping away if you do but
lift up a stone.  Do you think that I am the man
to endure being twitted with having begun an
enterprise which I had not the spirit to carry out,
a man to save his own neck by leaving his comrade
to be murdered by these brutal Afghans!"
</p>

<p>
"My danger is less then yours," observed Walter.
"In the first place I have the protection of poverty;
in the second I have made friends with the child of
a chief."
</p>

<p>
"What a bit of luck for us!" exclaimed Denis,
in a completely altered tone, throwing himself
again on the ground beside the glowing embers of
the fire.  "I certainly was born under some
auspicious star!  No sooner do I lose my rogue of
a guide, than up starts a powerful chief to act both
as guide and protector.  Of course I'll be hand and
glove with this Assad Khan; he'll introduce me at
Kandahar as his most particular friend.  Of course
I'll make him no end of promises,&mdash;one must never be
sparing of them.  I'll tell the chief that when I get
back to India, I'll send him my horse&mdash;a free
gift&mdash;and half-a-dozen others loaded with jewels for
pretty Sultána.  I'll make it the chief's interest to
stand my friend.  I'll see more of Afghan life than
any being in the world ever saw before.  Stay,
stay, I must write up my journal; where have I
put my ink-bottle?"
</p>

<p>
Denis, now in wild spirits, wrote for about five
minutes as if writing for life; he then threw down
his pen, and pushed the paper from him.  "That's
enough for to-night, I shall have plenty of time
to-morrow to write up my story."
</p>

<p>
"Will he have plenty of time?" thought Walter
to himself.  "Is not my gay, bold comrade beset
with dangers not the less real because he chooses to
shut his eyes as he takes the leap which may land
him&mdash;one shrinks from asking <i>where</i>!  I am the
only Christian near him, the only being who can
speak to him of that soul which may so soon be
required.  And yet, coward and faithless friend that
I am, I sit, as it were, with lips sealed, watching
his career towards the precipice over which he so
soon may plunge with a laugh on his lips!"
</p>

<p>
"Dermot," said Walter, aloud; "even you must
own that our lives are uncertain."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; it's a toss up whether you and I ever see
old Ireland again."
</p>

<p>
"Is it not well to be prepared for whatever may
happen?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I've looked both to my guns and pistols,"
was Denis's reply.
</p>

<p>
"It was not that which I meant.  I was thinking
of what follows death."
</p>

<p>
"You don't want me surely to set about making
my will?" exclaimed Denis.  "It is not needed;
if I die my estate must go to my brother."
</p>

<p>
"I am not speaking of worldly property.  I was
thinking that you&mdash;that we both&mdash;need to know
more of God's will, that we may be ready, should
He please to call us suddenly."  Walter took his
small pocket Testament from his bosom.  "I am
going to read my evening chapter; would you have
any objection to my reading aloud?"
</p>

<p>
"None in the world," replied Denis, lightly; "but
I can't promise to listen."
</p>

<p>
Walter selected his chapter, and selected well.
Never before had he so realised the force of the
expression, "Preaching as a dying man to dying
men."  Walter knew that at that moment stealthy
foes might be creeping towards them under the cover
of darkness, or that his reading might be interrupted
by a sudden volley from the thicket or the heights
above it.  But the feeling of peril which solemnised
the young Englishman did not at all un-nerve him;
Walter drank in the meaning of each life-giving
verse which he read.  His companion's perfect
silence encouraged Walter, till&mdash;when he closed
the book&mdash;he turned to look at Dermot Denis, and
saw him sunk in a deep slumber.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br><br>
THE STRUGGLE COMES.
</h3>

<p>
Walter's strange interview with the child
of the Eagle's Nest had strengthened the
missionary spirit in the young man's
breast.  He went over in thought every circumstance
of their brief meeting during the long hours
of his night-watch.  On this occasion Walter felt
no disposition to sleep; physical discomfort,
combined with mental anxiety to take away all desire
for repose.  The wind had arisen, and, rushing
through the pass as through a funnel, extinguished
the fire, put out even the hurricane-lamp, and
chilled the frame of the young sentinel.  Dermot
Denis, with characteristic thoughtlessness, had
appropriated the rug of his friend.  Though the
day had been hot, there was sharp keenness in the
night wind, and young Gurney missed his usual
protection.  It was only by motion that he could
keep up any degree of warmth.  As Walter paced
up and down, now facing the furious blast, now
almost swept down by its violence, watching the
wild lightning-illumined clouds above him, as
they seemed in their rapid course to blot out star
after star, Walter's spirit yearned over the Afghan
child in the power of the king of darkness.
</p>

<p>
"One wearing almost the form of an angel is
developing the instincts of a tigress," muttered
Walter to himself.  "Eyes that can express so
much of feminine tenderness can look complacently
at what a Christian girl would turn from with
sickening horror!  A heart made to reverence what
is holy and love what is good, a kindly&mdash;yes, I am
sure of it&mdash;a kindly affectionate heart, is filled with
bigotry and pride, and a debasing hunger after
plunder won by red-handed violence!  Oh, what
hath not Satan wrought in this miserable land;
and not only here, but over the widest tracks of
this fallen but beautiful earth!  Millions of
victims are lying in worse than Egyptian bondage,
whilst those who could carry to them the message
of deliverance are, as it were, quietly pasturing
their sheep amongst the comforts of civilised life.
Oh for the voice from the burning bush that gave
His commission to Moses!  Oh for the power to
say to the murderer of souls&mdash;<i>Let My people go that
they may serve Me</i>.  Lord! how long, how long
shall Thy servants rest in selfish indifference whilst
generation after generation perishes in darkness and
sin!  If it please Thee to prolong my life, let it be
the one object of that life to glorify Thee by
rescuing souls through the power of Thy spirit; it
is the object best worth living for&mdash;the object best
worth dying for!  Where does the fiery pillar lead
the believer but along the path consecrated by the
track of the Saviour's own footsteps.  He came to
seek and to save the lost."
</p>

<p>
Very fervently did Walter Gurney plead on that
tempestuous night for Sultána and her guilt-stained
race.  The sense of personal danger was almost lost
in the intense realisation of the spiritual peril of
others.  In wrestling supplication on that wild,
stormy night the hours wore away.  Walter felt
himself in the immediate presence of One who could
say to the wilder storm of human passion, the
sweeping blast of satanic power, <i>Peace, be still</i>!
Whatever outward circumstances may be, these are
blessed hours that are spent alone with God; they
are hours whose result will be seen through
countless ages, when corresponding to the fervour of
prayer will be the rapture of praise!
</p>

<p>
Walter had no difficulty on this night in arousing
Dermot Denis.  Partly on account of the boisterous
weather, partly from anticipation of a possible
attack, the young Irishman's sleep had been broken
and disturbed.  Ever and anon he would start, as
if his mind were still on the watch.
</p>

<p>
"It's miserably cold!" said Denis, as he rose to
take his turn as watcher.  "The wind howls and
yells and shrieks as if bad spirits were riding on
the blast!  This wretched rug is but a poor substitute
for the fur cloak carried off by that Afghan
thief!"
</p>

<p>
"It is a good deal better than nothing," remarked
the shivering Walter, as he stretched his weary
limbs on the cold, bare ground.
</p>

<p>
The wind lulled as the morning drew near, and
Walter was able to sleep.  Just at daybreak he was
suddenly wakened by the loud report of a pistol&mdash;another
and another.  Springing to his feet, Walter
beheld Denis struggling on the ground in the midst
of a throng of fierce Afghans.  Gurney rushed
to the aid of his friend, but was instantly struck
down by a blow from the butt end of a musket.
Long Afghan knives were gleaming around; both
the European travellers thought that their last hour
was come.  Resistance was hopeless, though Denis
had wounded two of the robbers ere he fell
overpowered by numbers.
</p>

<p>
"Kill, kill the Kafirs!" was the cry.
</p>

<p>
"Don't kill&mdash;keep us for ransom&mdash;take us to
the chief Assad!" gasped forth Walter with
difficulty, for an Afghan's strong hand was griping his
throat.
</p>

<p>
The word "ransom" acted like a charm upon
the assailants; it was passed from mouth to mouth,
the thirst for gold overpowering even the thirst
for blood.  Happily neither of the Afghans whom
Denis had shot were mortally wounded, or his life
would assuredly have been the forfeit.  His bold
but useless resistance aggravated the severity of the
treatment which he now received at the hands of
his cruel captors.  Both the prisoners were plundered
of their watches, and Denis, who alone wore rings,
had them violently wrenched from his fingers.  He
was stripped to the waist, the gold studs in his
shirt exciting the cupidity of the Afghans, who
hoped to find more treasure on the person of one so
rich.  Denis was struck on the face, having first been
deprived of his handsome topi; his arms were tied
tightly behind him, his struggles making the cords
cut almost into his flesh.  Then, as he lay writhing
on the ground, the unfortunate traveller was brutally
kicked by his persecutors, who laughed at the vain
fury of their victim, who, in his own language, was
pouring on them abuse and imprecations.
</p>

<p>
Walter, partly on account of his poverty, and
partly on account of his quietness, had less to
endure.  When a rude robber was about to strip
him of his well-worn coat, a younger and more
pleasant-looking Afghan interfered.
</p>

<p>
"Leave him alone," said the young man.  "I
trow he is the son of the Santgunge Padri, who has
shown kindness ere now to Afghans.
</p>

<p>
"I would not leave him the rag, Ali Khan,"
cried the man, "if it were fit for my wear.  I shall
find something better worth having yonder," and
off he rushed to join the group who were ransacking
Denis's trunk.
</p>

<p>
Walter was glad indeed to retain his garment,
and with it his little Testament, and the leaves of
his father's translation, to him a treasure more
precious than gold.  He, however, had his arms bound
behind him, and received his share of Moslem abuse,
in which Ali Khan did not join.  The captives were
witnesses to the glee with which their property was
disposed of, not without a considerable amount of
loud talking and wrangling over the spoils.  The
muleteers had fled at the first alarm; their animals
were, of course, the booty of the captors.  Two
Afghans mounted on Denis's horse; how he longed
to see it plunge and throw them!  The trunks
were cut open with daggers, and rudely emptied of
their contents.  There was a fierce scramble for the
gold and silver; a bottle of brandy was surreptitiously
carried off beneath the blanket of a
follower of the False Prophet, a mountaineer who had
learnt to appreciate the fiery poison.  Denis's fine
embroidered shirts caused a great amount of mirth,
and were pulled over <i>kurtas</i> (vests) that had been
worn day and night unchanged for years.
</p>

<p>
When the work of pillage was over, the prisoners
were made to rise and accompany their captors to
the copse in which Sultána had had her adventure.
They were led through it to a steep and precipitous
path which was familiar to the Pathans.  With
their hands bound behind them it was almost
impossible for the Europeans to climb so rude an
ascent, though both were agile men; but when they
paused they were pushed and kicked by the Afghans
behind them.
</p>

<p>
"You must have the use of your hands, Feringhee,"
said Ali Khan, cutting Walter's cords with his
knife.
</p>

<p>
"Show the same mercy to my unfortunate friend,
brave youth!" cried Walter, the sufferings of Denis
distressing him more than his own.
</p>

<p>
"He has shed the blood of my kinsmen; he shall
never find mercy from me!" was the stern reply of
Ali Khan.  "He is like the wild beast that struggles
and bites when caught in the snare; thou art calm
as a man who submits to fate."
</p>

<p>
It was a matter of surprise to Walter himself, as
well as to the young mountaineer, that he could
preserve such composure under circumstances so
painful.  We need not seek far for the cause of
such calmness.  One who habitually looks to the
fiery cloudy pillar for guidance, finds that it gives
light in the darkest night of trial, shade under the
fiercest glow of temptation.  All that the Christian
holds most dear is beyond the reach of robbers;
he can never lose his all.  What marvel if that
man is patient who knows that all things work
together for his good,&mdash;and brave when assured
that death itself is but the angel that uncloses the
gate of paradise.
</p>

<p>
It was far otherwise with the miserable Denis,
who, on account of his bonds, was utterly unable
to keep up with Walter and the foremost Afghans,
who soon passed beyond his view.  As he could not
help himself with his hands, his tumbles and slips
on a path which at some places "scarce gave footing
for the goat," afforded his tormentors a cause
for mirth and added brutality.  When, after a
painful fall of several feet, Denis obstinately refused
to move, he was goaded to stagger again to his feet
by the points of daggers.
</p>

<p>
"Hell itself could not be worse than this!  Hell
must be like this!" groaned the tortured man.
"The company of tormenting demons, the memory
of past joys lost for ever, and the fierce anguish of
knowing that my own mad folly has brought me to
this,&mdash;earth has no misery like mine."  Passages
from Scripture hardly ever recurred to the mind of
the spoilt child of fortune; but in his anguish Denis
did think of one who had been clothed in purple
and fine linen, one who had fared sumptuously every
day, and at last had to make his bed in the flames.
The idea did flash across Denis's mind, "My fate is
something like his."
</p>

<p>
The savage Pathans had at last to cut the bonds
of Denis; but not from pity, but a selfish fear that
their captive, by dying on the way, might escape
from their hands without paying a ransom.  The
latter part of that terrible journey was to Denis like
a horrible dream.  It was in an almost swooning
state that the once splendid-looking young Irishman
was led into the rough hill-fort which, from its
lofty position, was called the Eagle's Nest.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br><br>
PRISON LIFE.
</h3>

<p>
A person of weak constitution might have
sunk under such sufferings as Dermot Denis
had had to endure; but he had a strong and
vigorous frame.  Walter, who had arrived some
time before him, and who saw almost with horror
the state of his unfortunate friend, as Denis sank
on the floor beside him, was surprised at the
rapidity with which the Irishman rallied when he
had drained the contents of an earthen vessel which
Walter held to his lips.
</p>

<p>
"I'll live to be revenged on them yet," cried Denis,
raising himself to a sitting position, and shaking back
the clotted hair from his bruised and bleeding brow.
</p>

<p>
Walter did all he could for his comrade, but
that all was little, as he himself was in a destitute
state.  He pulled off his own shooting-coat to
cover Denis, and by entreaties persuaded Ali Khan
to bring a fresh supply of water, which he used in
bathing the sufferer's hurts.
</p>

<p>
Denis surveyed his prison, more to see what
chance it afforded him of future escape than what
it could yield of present comfort.
</p>

<p>
Comfort! the word is a mockery!  The room,
or den, as Denis called it, was about twelve feet
square, on an upper storey in the fort.  There was
a hole on the north side, about five feet above the
floor, which admitted air and light; of course it
was unfurnished with glass&mdash;in that place a luxury
unknown.  There was not even a scrap of matting
on the dirty floor, not an article of furniture of any
description; no fittings, unless one strong iron hook,
which seemed to have been built into the stone
wall, could be reckoned as such.  Opposite to the
hole was a door, which opened on a kind of ladder-stair
which led down into the open court-yard.
This court-yard was an irregular square; the side
opposite to the prison was bounded by a high
strong wall, loop-holed for muskets, with a massive
gate in the centre, the only means of access to the
fort.  The remaining three sides of the quadrangle
were supported by rude pillars of unhewn stone,
supporting the upper storey.  Under these pillars
were open recesses, which seemed to be the common
abode of the inhabitants of the fort and such
animals as they possessed.  The cow and her calf,
sheep kept for slaughter, poultry, their half-starved
dogs, women busy at their small primitive
spinning-wheels, or engaged in cooking operations, men
smoking their bubbling hookahs, or cleaning their
arms, dirty children wearing more jewels than
clothes, occupied these recesses, or the open space
of the court.  In the centre of all was the well,
indispensable in a fort which might any day have
to stand a siege in that land of blood-feuds and
broils.  A medley of sounds arose from the courtyard,
barking and bleating, singing and swearing,
the crow of the cock and the cry of the child.  Such
was the scene which the captives surveyed through
the open door of their prison.
</p>

<p>
The view from the window, or rather aperture in
the wall, was of a precipice, dotted here and there
with thin clumps of brushwood&mdash;a precipice so
deep that the dwellers in the Eagle's Nest defied an
enemy to attack from that side, or a prisoner to make
his escape.  The window commanded a wild and
picturesque view, but the captives were in no mood
to think much of scenery then.  They saw their
den draperied with cobwebs, which had hung
undisturbed for many long years.  Insects crawled
over the uneven floor and up the rude stone walls,
and the air was alive with mosquitoes.  The place
presented a terrible contrast to Denis's luxurious
home in his own green isle.
</p>

<p>
Even the gloomy privacy and silence of a prison
were unattainable luxuries here.  The door of the
room occupied by the captives opened from the
outside, and Ali Khan, after bringing the water,
had unfortunately left it open.  A fit of curiosity
was on the residents of the fort.  Afghans crowded
up the narrow ladder-stair to gaze at the unfortunate
Feringhees, and load them with insults.  The
room was crowded almost to suffocation with rude
men and mocking, grinning children; whilst women,
staring up from the court-yard, added their laughing
comments on the appearance of the captives above.
Walter endured the annoyance in silence; Denis
hurled back insult for insult, but happily neither
he nor his tormentors understood each other's terms
of abuse.  This misery lasted for nearly an hour,
when happily some arrival in the Eagle's Nest
diverted the attention of the intruders, and the
Afghans swarmed down the ladder-staircase as
hastily as they had swarmed up.
</p>

<p>
"Walter, a week of this would drive me stark
mad!" exclaimed Denis.
</p>

<p>
"I will ask our good-natured Ali Khan to close
the door when he comes next time," said Walter;
and as he spoke the young Afghan appeared with
the prisoners' food.  This food consisted of a loaf,
or rather lump of black bread, most repulsive in
appearance, only half-baked, and the flour of which
it was made mixed with bits of straw and grains of sand.
</p>

<p>
"That stuff is not fit for hounds!" exclaimed
Denis; "the very pigs would despise it!  I've a
mind to fling it back at the fellow's head!"
</p>

<p>
"Do not make an enemy of the only being who
has shown a grain of humanity!" cried Walter.  "I
suppose that as regards our food, prisoners must not
be choosers."  Then turning towards Ali Khan,
young Gurney with courtesy inquired who had just
arrived in the fort.
</p>

<p>
"My uncle, our brave chief, Assad Khan."
</p>

<p>
Denis caught the sound of the name, and his
whole countenance brightened.
</p>

<p>
"Then it is as I hoped!" he exclaimed; "we are
in the hands of a gallant warrior whom we have laid
under deep obligation, and who will be delighted to
serve us.  It is the old story of Androcles and the
lion,&mdash;gratitude is the one virtue of savages and wild beasts."
</p>

<p>
"I hope not confined to them," said Walter;
"nor would I have you build your hopes too high
on the gratitude of an Afghan."
</p>

<p>
"Bid Ali Khan tell his chief that the preserver
of his child is here, and with him his friend, able
and willing to reward liberally all who serve him
faithfully.  And let him tell Assad Khan that the
first favour which I shall ask at his hands is that
he should soundly bastinado the ruffians who have
robbed, insulted, and imprisoned me here."
</p>

<p>
Walter translated but a portion of Denis's speech,
adding a request to Ali Khan that the prisoners might
not be subjected to sudden inroads from crowds, at
least till the captives had been granted an interview
with the leader.
</p>

<p>
"I will lock you in," said the youth, "and give
the key to no one unless the chief demands it."
</p>

<p>
The closing of the door was not an unmixed
advantage, as it lessened the circulation of air, and
excluded from the captives all view of the courtyard.
Yet anything, at the time, seemed better
than the inroad of Afghan intruders.
</p>

<p>
Walter took up the black bread, and breaking it
into two equal portions, gave one to his comrade.
"We need our breakfast," said he.
</p>

<p>
"You will hardly give thanks over it," observed
Denis, with a look of disgust.
</p>

<p>
"I shall give thanks, heartfelt thanks," replied
Walter, with animation, "not merely for food, but
for preservation in imminent danger from sudden
and violent death!" and, with the bread in his
hand, he sank on his knees.  Denis, solemnised for
a while, intuitively followed his comrade's example,
and if he did not feel all the gratitude which warmed
the breast of his friend, he could at least heartily
join in Walter's prayer for help and deliverance.  It
was perhaps the first time in Dermot's life that he
had actually prayed; and even now his desires did
not rise above earth.
</p>

<p>
Thankful to have seen Denis for once on his
knees, and hopeful that to him tribulation might
prove "an angel in disguise," Walter ate his wretched
food with something like relish.  Denis was weary
and hungry, and left not a crumb of what he had
judged unfit for hounds.  Both the prisoners then
found in the sleep of exhaustion a short respite from
trouble.
</p>

<p>
The rest of the day was spent by Denis in feverish
impatience for the visit of the chief from which he
hoped so much.  He set diligently to work to learn
from Walter words and phrases in Pushtoo, finding
his ignorance of the language a perpetual source of
annoyance.  Denis tried to get up speeches full of
flowery compliments, and containing splendid offers,
which he assured his companion that no Oriental
could resist.
</p>

<p>
"I should like to have met the chief in a costume
more befitting a man of position," said Denis,
passing his hand through his thick curly hair for
want of his ivory comb.  "This wretched coat of
yours is so tight! made for a slender stripling like
you, I can't stir my arms for bursting the seams&mdash;it's
like a straight-jacket for a madman!  I'd give
something for a scarlet uniform, with epaulettes
and gold lace.  With my battered face, and a coat
like this, I look like a ragamuffin!"
</p>

<p>
Walter could not help smiling at the handsome
Irishman's pathetic complaint.
</p>

<p>
Denis strode up and down the narrow apartment,
exclaiming against the heat and the mosquitoes,
and often pausing before the hole of a window to
measure with his eye the depth of the precipice
below, and calculate the possibility of a descent.
He always turned away disappointed, yet in a few
minutes was at the aperture again.  As long as
enough of daylight remained, Walter occupied
himself with his father's translation, amidst
frequent interruptions from Denis.
</p>

<p>
"It is growing quite dark!" cried the Irishman.
"This interminable day is coming at last to an end.
I wonder what has become of the chief; I thought
he'd have hurried to see us at once."
</p>

<p>
"He is coming now," observed Walter Gurney;
"do you not hear voices approaching&mdash;yes, there
are feet on the stairs."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br><br>
THE AFGHAN CHIEF.
</h3>

<p>
<a id="p87"></a>
Slow turns the grating key&mdash;the door is thrown
open, and a party of Afghans enter, the
foremost the chief himself.  A very striking
figure was that of Assad Khan, as seen by the light
of torches carried by his attendants.  Though not
so tall as either of his captives, he looked the very
type of the chief of a robber horde.  Most of the
Pathans had skull-caps over their wild black hair,
but Assad Khan wore a magnificent turban, with a
border and fringe of gold.  A red Cashmere shawl
fell in rich folds over the chief's broad shoulders,
another was wrapt as a girdle round his waist, and
in it was stuck a jewelled hilted dagger.  Assad
Khan was a powerful-looking man; pride was in
the glance of his eye, and his step was as that of a
desert lion.  He surveyed his prisoners with a keen
and piercing gaze.
</p>

<p>
Dermot Denis, nothing daunted, began his studied
speech in the most broken Pushtoo; Assad Khan
impatiently cut him short.  The Afghan turned
towards the only prisoner who could understand
him, and began the conversation by a series of
rapid questions, which Walter answered as well as
he could.  Denis, with eager eyes, turned from the
one speaker to the other, straining his attention to
catch the meaning of what was said, and longing
to put in a word.
</p>

<p>
"You say that you do not know this man's object
in going to Kandahar?" asked the chief.
</p>

<p>
"He's talking of me&mdash;what does he say?" cried
Denis; Walter interpreted the question, which
Denis hastened to answer himself.
</p>

<p>
"Friendship&mdash;very great friendship&mdash;Kandahar
big noble prince!" said the Irishman, using the
few words he knew, without much regard for truth.
</p>

<p>
"The chief of Kandahar is the mortal foe of
Assad Khan!" exclaimed the Afghan, striking the
ground fiercely with the musket which he held in
his hand.
</p>

<p>
The gesture and the savage expression on the
chief's face, more than his partially understood
words, showed Denis that he had made an unfortunate
blunder.  He was obliged to fall back on
his interpreter, Walter.
</p>

<p>
"Tell him that if it be impossible for me, with
his generous aid, to pursue my journey amongst the
most noble, most respectable, hospitable&mdash;don't
spare your superlatives, Walter&mdash;hospitable people
of this land, I would wish to return to India.  I am
ready to pay a ransom."
</p>

<p>
Walter explained the general purport of what
his companion had said.  Assad Khan replied in a
haughty tone, "Tell him, that the stranger who
comes unbidden into our land with secret designs,
is likely to find his grave amidst our mountains.
However, he being rich, may purchase my mercy."  The
robber named as ransom a most exorbitant
sum, adding, with a stern smile, "If it be paid I'll
throw your freedom into the bargain; you were of
some service to a child of our race."
</p>

<p>
When Walter translated the chief's reply to
Denis, the warm-tempered Irishman could not
refrain from a burst of indignation at the cupidity
of his captor.
</p>

<p>
"The unconscionable thief! he would ruin a
Crœsus! he sells his black bread dear with a
vengeance!  Tell him I'm poor&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I cannot say that," observed Walter.
</p>

<p>
"You must meet a man on his own ground,"
cried Denis impatiently; "we are in the land of
liars and thieves!"
</p>

<p>
"Does the Kafir agree?" asked the chief.
</p>

<p>
Walter did his best to negotiate more reasonable
terms, but Assad Khan, stood firm to his offer.  He
knew the captives to be completely within his
power, and had experience in the art of extracting
gold by ill-treatment, and even torture.
</p>

<p>
"To comply with my demand is your only
chance of leaving this fort alive," said Assad Khan,
turning towards Denis, and making his meaning
almost intelligible by his significant gestures.  "Do
not dream of escape.  I had a Jewish merchant in
this very room.  He flinched from paying the
ransom which I demanded; perhaps the fox was not
able to pay it.  He made an attempt to get out,
was caught, was flogged within an inch of his life.
After awhile the madman tried the same thing
again.  Do you see yon hook?"&mdash;the chief pointed
to the one in the wall; "I had him hanged by the
neck from that hook, and that was the end of his
story, as it will be of yours if you follow his example."
</p>

<p>
The Afghans who had entered the room with
their chief, or stood on the ladder outside, burst
into rude laughter at remembering the murder of
the unfortunate Jew.
</p>

<p>
"Have you never heard what the Beloochees did
with the Feringhee doctor who ventured amongst
them?" pursued the chief.  "Did they not believe
that if they killed him, his body would be changed
into ducats? and so he was slain in his bed, and
his corpse hung up for fifteen days.  The Beloochees
finding this was in vain, cut up the doctor's papers
into little bits, and mixed them with the mortar
of a house which the chief was building, in hopes
that it would presently be adorned with a layer of
gold.*  I have more faith in getting gold from a
live Feringhee than a dead one, or I might take a
lesson from the Beloochees."  Assad Khan laughed,
and his followers echoed his laugh.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* This horrible story is given as a <i>fact</i> by the traveller,
General Ferrier.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Bid him send for paper and ink.  I'll write to
Calcutta for money; anything, anything to get out
of this den of bloodthirsty tigers!"
</p>

<p>
Writing materials were readily produced.  Denis
had difficulty in tracing intelligible letters with the
reed pen, and though he was a very courageous
man, his hand was scarcely as steady as usual.  A
short note, however, was written, which the
suspicious Assad Khan made Walter translate twice over
before he gave it to an Afghan who was to bear it
to the nearest Government official in India, who
would transmit it to Calcutta.
</p>

<p>
As the chief now looked contented, and almost
good-humoured, Walter took occasion to complain
of the wretched food, and of the rude insolence to
which the captives had been subjected.  He
appealed to the chief's better feelings, in hopes that
such might exist.  Denis made his companion
translate a request that the door which communicated
with the court-yard might now be left open,
but the Afghans be strictly prohibited from
invading the privacy of the captives.
</p>

<p>
This trifling boon was readily accorded.  Assad
Khan also promised that better food should be sent.
He remained for some time longer in conversation with
Walter, the chief gratifying his curiosity by asking
many questions regarding India and England, and
trying pertinaciously to find out why the Kafirs had
entered his country.  He declared that they must
be Government spies.
</p>

<p>
At last the long interview came to a close.  The
chief and his followers descended the stairs, and
almost till midnight might be seen in the courtyard
smoking hookahs, telling stories, and singing
their wild native airs.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the last Afghan had quitted the
prison, Denis gave full vent to the indignation
which was boiling over in his breast, certainly not
sparing his superlatives, which were by no means of
a kind complimentary to the Afghans.
</p>

<p>
"I'll not pay a rupee&mdash;not a pice of the ransom
to fatten these rogues!" he exclaimed.  "I'm no
wretched Jew to be tortured and hanged!  I'll
make my escape from these thieves!"
</p>

<p>
"I fear that you will find escape impossible,"
said Walter.
</p>

<p>
"Impossible! there's not such a word in my grammar.
To men with quick brain and strong arm there's
nothing impossible!" cried Denis.  "I shall
certainly make an attempt to get off, and if the
ruffians murder me, I'll just see what vengeance the
English will take!  Don't you feel a thirst for
revenge?" he asked, turning with clenched hand
towards Walter.
</p>

<p>
"The only revenge for which I thirst, is to see
these fierce robbers transformed into civilised
Christians," was the young man's reply.
</p>

<p>
"As well might tigers be transformed into lambs!
Such changes can never be!" exclaimed Denis.
</p>

<p>
"Such changes <i>have</i> been, and <i>may</i> be again,"
said the missionary's son.  "To One who is all-wise
and all-powerful too, there is nothing impossible&mdash;even
an Afghan's conversion!"  Walter turned and
gazed through the aperture on the glittering stars
in the deep blue sky, and added, though not aloud,
"Such changes will be, though the time may be far
distant, for it is written in the Word of Truth, <i>The
earth shall be full of the knowledge of the glory of
the Lord, as the waters cover the sea</i>."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br><br>
CONSCIENCE AWAKENED.
</h3>

<p>
"This is the Lord's Day," said Walter, with a
touch of sadness in his tone as he rose on
the following morning from his comfortless
resting-place on the bare and dirty floor.
</p>

<p>
"Sunday, is it, only Sunday?" exclaimed Denis;
"I feel as if weeks had passed since we started on
our luckless expedition.  If we measured time by
misery, we might count the days as years!  What
a different Sunday this will be from those I once
enjoyed!"
</p>

<p>
The same thought was passing through the mind
of Walter.  Each of the young men was thinking
of scenes that might never again meet their eyes.
Before Walter came the image of the small native
church, with the little band of Christians whom his
father had been the instrument of gathering from
the heathen around them.  In fancy, Walter heard
the tinkling bell that summoned to worship; then
the hymn, not very harmonious, but so heartily
sung that it warmed the listener's heart.  The
image of his father, pale, thin, prematurely grey,
but with heaven's own peace on his face, rose before
the mind's eye of the youth; Walter could almost
hear the accents, not strong, but thrilling, which
told of the unspeakable bliss of the bright abode
upon whose threshold he stood.  Walter could not
suppress a sigh.
</p>

<p>
And memory drew also a sigh, and a heavy one,
from Dermot Denis.  He thought of merry shooting
parties over Erin's green fields, or games of billiards
in his own luxurious home.  Then fancy wandered
to London, and he was again in Hyde Park, amongst
the equestrians in Rotten Row, meeting acquaintances
at every turn, bowing, laughing, making his
horse curvet, with a pleasant consciousness that he
himself was, perhaps, the most striking figure
amongst the fashionable throng.  Or there was a
drive in a four-in-hand with jovial companions to
feast at Richmond.  Ah! the thought of a feast to
an almost famished man, who had nothing but
black bread to eat!  For Assad Khan had either
forgotten his promise to send better food, or had
deliberately broken it, choosing to keep down the
strength and spirit of his captives by bringing them
to a state of semi-starvation.  This was all the
more irritating as there were no signs of scarcity
in the court-yard which the prisoners' room overlooked.
</p>

<p>
An hour after rising, Walter seated himself,
Oriental fashion, directly in front of the open door.
His appearance called forth a few insults and jests
from the Afghans below, and fragments of melon-rind
were thrown at his head; but, restrained by
the orders of the chief, no one dared to set a foot
on the ladder.  Insult was also changed to sudden
silence when the prisoner began to chant verses
aloud, to the wild, monotonous air of an Indian
<i>bhajan</i>.  Walter's voice was a very fine one, and
the sound drew immediate attention.  The woman
at her wheel, the bihisté* drawing water, the warrior
burnishing his weapon or smoking his hookah,
listened to the Feringhee minstrel; the very
children left their play to cluster around the
foot of the ladder.  When, after about ten
minutes, the singer paused, a clamour arose of
"Go on!"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Water-carrier.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"He's a strange fellow who sings when others
would curse or groan," said one of the wild denizens
of the mountains.  "The Feringhee may be shot
or hanged to-morrow, but he sings like one at a
wedding-feast."
</p>

<p>
Walter took care not to weary his audience; at
the first signs of restlessness amongst his hearers,
he rose and retired from their view.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Walter, what was that extraordinary
chant with which, like a second Orpheus, you were
taming the beasts?" asked Denis.
</p>

<p>
"I was chanting part of my father's Pushtoo
translation."
</p>

<p>
"You don't mean to say that you were repeating
anything from the Bible to those savage,
bloodthirsty, Mohammedan bigots?"
</p>

<p>
"I commenced with what never provokes even
a Moslem," replied the missionary's son; "I gave
the Afghans part of the Sermon on the Mount."
</p>

<p>
"And are you insane enough to imagine that it
has done, or could do good to any one here?" asked
Denis.
</p>

<p>
"It has done good to myself," was the quiet reply.
</p>

<p>
"How&mdash;what do you mean?" inquired Denis.
</p>

<p>
"I repeated to others a lesson which I need to
take home to my own heart,&mdash;<i>Love your enemies</i>."
</p>

<p>
"I will never love nor forgive an Afghan,"
exclaimed Denis, and he finished the sentence with
a muttered curse.
</p>

<p>
"God helping me, I will," thought Walter.  He
had found that one of the greatest aids to obeying
the Saviour's difficult command, is to try to <i>do good
to them that hate you</i>.  The youth had that day
made his first attempt to shed a gleam of Gospel
light upon his cruel oppressors.  It cast a glorious
radiance upon Walter's own soul,&mdash;the pillar which
rested over his prison was indeed a pillar of light.
</p>

<p>
A little later in the day Walter resumed his
singing.  This time the story of Zaccheus was his
theme.  Denis stood close by to amuse himself in his
dreary bondage by watching the various expressions
on the upturned faces below.
</p>

<p>
"Look there, Walter! there's a beauty, a perfect
little <i>houri</i>!"* exclaimed Dermot Denis suddenly,
as he caught sight of a child about eight years of
age, who, attracted by the music, had come down by
some unseen staircase which led to the upper
apartments occupied by the family of the chief.  The
girl was leaning against one of the pillars, half in
the shadow of a recess.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Houris are the beautiful beings who are supposed to wait
on believers in Paradise.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"It is Sultána!" cried Walter, who had just
finished his chant.  The child caught his eye and
bounded forward, her face beaming with pleasure at
the sight of her Feringhee preserver.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! here comes good fortune in the shape of
an Afghan fairy!" ejaculated Denis.  Determined
to make the most of it, the Irishman pressed forward
in his eagerness to gain the child's attention, half
pushing his companion aside that he himself might
occupy the foremost place.  "Hungry, big hungry,"
cried Denis, in his imperfect Pushtoo.  He pointed
to his own mouth, then pointing to his friend,
indicated that Walter also was suffering privation.
Denis could think of no other Pushtoo at the
moment but "kill sheep;" but it seemed to him to
express what he desired to say like a telegraphic
message.
</p>

<p>
Sultána's smile showed that she understood the
tall stranger.  She only said, however, "I will bring
something, but not now; I cannot stay, I am
wanted," and she vanished into the dark recess
from which she had just emerged.
</p>

<p>
But it was as if in these few minutes the fairy
had scattered a whole shower of blossoms over the
path of the sanguine and volatile Denis.  The love
of romance, which was strong in him, was gratified,
and his excessively sanguine spirit built an airy
fabric of hope on the smile of a child.  Sultána
would aid his escape, he knew it; he would win
the little one's heart,&mdash;it was a pity that she was only
a child.  Denis had unbounded confidence in his
own powers of persuasion if only he were able to
speak; but who could plead effectually with a
vocabulary so limited as his!  For hours Denis did
nothing but ask Walter to translate words and sentences
into Pushtoo.  The Irishman learnt eagerly and
with rapidity, his anxiety to speak quickening his
apprehension, and strengthening a memory naturally
good.  Denis was proud of his own progress, and
impatient to make use of his new acquisitions.  Why
did not Sultána return?  Was she, the beautiful
child, also a faithless, ungrateful Afghan!
</p>

<p>
About sunset a furious squabble arose between
two Afghans outside the fort, who were evidently
likely to come to blows.  The outer gate being
not yet locked, as it invariably was at night, most
of the inhabitants of the Eagle's Nest thronged out
to see the <i>tamasha</i>.  The court-yard was clear, save
of a few old women, and children too young even to
enjoy the sight of a fray.  As if seizing her
opportunity, from a different recess from that in which
she had at first disappeared, came forth little
Sultána, her speed only checked by the necessity
of carrying something with care.  She climbed the
ladder with the agility of a cat, not needing to make
use of her hands.  Wrapt up in what Denis
recognised as a silk handkerchief of his own, was
something which the child eagerly placed in the hands
of Walter.  "It is good, eat it&mdash;and quickly," said
the girl.
</p>

<p>
The handkerchief contained a large portion of a
delicate kid, cooked to perfection on hot stones
placed in a hole, a fashion of Afghan cooking which
was quite new to Denis.  The captives, it need
not be said, had no knives or forks, dishes or
plates; but to men who had starved for two days
on black bread, no accessories were needed.  Sultána
stood by, smiling to see how the meal was enjoyed.
Denis was too busily engaged in eating even to
make use of his newly-acquired sentences in
Pushtoo.  His appetite was worthy of an Afghan.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know how I got that for you?" asked
Sultána of Walter, who was the first to end his repast.
</p>

<p>
"You coaxed your father to send it."
</p>

<p>
"No, my father would send nothing," said the
child, "though I begged him until he was angry.
I will tell you how I got it," she went on, in a low
confidential tone.  "Mir Ghazan was baking his
kid, but I determined that some one else should
eat it.  So I ran up to him, and said, 'Oh!  Mir
Ghazan, I saw just now a fine cheetah outside the
fort; I think it's hid in the jungle; if you're quick
you may shoot it!' for I knew that he wanted a
cheetah's skin; he told me so a few days ago.  Up
jumped Mir Ghazan," continued the girl, mirth
dancing in her blue eyes; "he seized his gun, and
off he went, and I ran away with the kid."
</p>

<p>
"O Sultána! if I had known this, I would not
have eaten the kid," said Walter, in a tone of gentle reproach.
</p>

<p>
"Why, didn't you want food?" said the little Afghan.
</p>

<p>
"Do you remember, dear Sultána, that when we
were in the jungle together I taught you that <i>God
is love</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and you taught me to pray, 'Allah! teach
me to know Thee.  Allah! teach me to love
Thee.'  I've done it too," said the child.
</p>

<p>
"God is not only loving, but He is holy, most
holy, Sultána, and those who know Him and love
Him He always makes holy also.  God has forbidden
us to lie and to steal."
</p>

<p>
"Do you never lie or steal?" asked the girl, in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"I try not to disobey the great God's commands,
and He helps me, for I ask Him for help," said
Walter.  "Sultána, without God's aid we can do
nothing but sin."
</p>

<p>
The idea of sin was a new one to the little
Afghan.  "What is sin?" she said, inquiringly.
</p>

<p>
"Disobeying the commands of a holy God.  Shall
I tell you, my child, how sin and sorrow and death
first came into this beautiful world?  It was by one
lie, that of Satan; one taking of forbidden fruit by
a woman."
</p>

<p>
Sultána seated herself at the Englishman's feet
to listen, and with earnest attention heard the
story of the Fall.
</p>

<p>
"And now, Sultána, do you remember the song
which I was singing, about the Holy Teacher who
came to the house of a man who was a great sinner."
</p>

<p>
"I heard the song," said Sultána.
</p>

<p>
"The Master forgave the man's sin, and loved
him; but did the man then remain a thief and a
liar, as it seems likely that he had been before?"
</p>

<p>
A troubled expression came over the lovely face
of the child.  When conscience is for the first time
awakened, does it not usually awake with a pang?
Sultána gave no direct reply; she only said with a
sigh, "If your great Pir (holy man) were to come
to the Afghans, and bid them not lie and loot, I
think that they would kill him."
</p>

<p>
"The Jews <i>did</i> kill our great Master," said
Walter; "I will tell you that story another time, Sultána."

<h3>
CHAPTER Xi.
<br><br>
REPENTANCE AND REPARATION.
</h3>

<p>
In the meantime Denis had finished his very
ample repast.  "Better take enough for three
days," he thought; "for who knows when I
may have such another dinner again!"  He then
took the well-picked bones, and threw them out of
the hole which served as a window.  Denis had a
shrewd idea that Sultána had not come quite lawfully
by her prize, though he understood very little
of the conversation passing between her and his
friend.
</p>

<p>
The Irishman had no intention of letting Walter
monopolise the attention of the pretty little Afghan;
he had resolved to win the child's heart.  Denis
was indeed aware that he did not appear to
advantage in his present deplorable guise; his hair
matted, tangled, and stained, and his face marred
with scratches and bruises.  Walter's threadbare
coat had split in more than one place, and the
remaining part of Denis's dress was so ragged and
soiled, that it afforded no temptation even to an
Afghan spoiler.  Denis would not have chosen to be
seen thus in Bond Street, but in a robber's fort in
Afghanistan deficiencies would be less noticed.
</p>

<p>
"The real gentleman shines forth in any costume,"
thought the Irishman; "if I can trust less
to my appearance, I must trust more to my wits."  Then,
recalling to memory his well-conned speech,
Denis thus addressed the Afghan child.
</p>

<p>
"Come, speak me, Sultána, houri! pearl of
garden! rose of sea!"  It is not to be wondered at
if the orator made a few blunders in airing his
newly-acquired Pushtoo.
</p>

<p>
The child surveyed him with an expression of
mingled curiosity and doubt.  She listened, but did
not move from her place by Walter.
</p>

<p>
Denis, considering the extreme poverty of his
materials, made a marvellous display of eloquence,
aiding his halting tongue by expressive signs.  "I,
prince&mdash;great prince" (he pointed to himself),
"Sultána, beautiful" (and again came the string of
flattering epithets learned by heart).  "Sultána,
help&mdash;prince&mdash;get away&mdash;prince send
elephant&mdash;English&mdash;silver howdah&mdash;big gold&mdash;Sultána, houri,
much glad."
</p>

<p>
"Is he a prince?" looking up inquiringly at her
first European friend.
</p>

<p>
"Not shahzáda (prince) but gentleman," replied
Walter, giving his comrade the title in Pushtoo
which would most truthfully describe his position
in life.
</p>

<p>
"Has he an English elephant with silver
howdah?" asked Sultána.
</p>

<p>
"Not that&mdash;but gold to buy one," was the
hesitating reply.
</p>

<p>
"Come, houri, pearl of garden," resumed Denis
in his most insinuating tone.
</p>

<p>
"I will not come, you tell lies!" said the child;
and with this brief and startling rebuke she quitted
the room.
</p>

<p>
A woeful sight met Sultána, as with light step she
descended the ladder.  The two men whose quarrel
had given her an opportunity of carrying the
stolen food to the captives, after for half-an-hour
bandying fierce words and blows, had at last taken
to their knives&mdash;no uncommon way of settling a
dispute in the Eagle's Nest.  The result was that
both were now carried through the gateway into
the fort, groaning and bleeding.  The sight of
wounds was too common to shock the little Afghan
on ordinary occasions; but now in the sufferers she
recognised Mir Ghazan and Ali Khan.  The latter
was a favourite with Sultána, as the youth had, in
boyhood, often carried his lovely little cousin in
his arms, and made a playmate of the beautiful
child.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mir Ghazan, you wolf! why did you stab
him?" exclaimed Sultána.
</p>

<p>
"He stole my kid!" cried Mir Ghazan.
</p>

<p>
"I did not!" was the angry denial; the war
which had been carried on with knives, was
prolonged in fierce words, mingled with groans.
</p>

<p>
"He did not&mdash;it was I who stole your kid!"
exclaimed Sultána; "I was like Eve,&mdash;the harm
comes from me, and if they die, I have killed
them!"  The hot tears which filled and brimmed over the
little girl's eyes were tears of repentance.  For the
first time in her life the Afghan felt conviction of
sin, the sin of breaking a commandment of God
and incurring His wrath.  Not an hour before
Sultána had been utterly ignorant of its nature,
but what Walter had written on a child's heart now
seemed to flash forth in letters of fire.  Sultána saw
in the wounds, and heard in the groans, the result
of sin&mdash;<i>her own sin</i>!
</p>

<p>
This recognition of sin and its nature may seem
but the alphabet in spiritual knowledge; but, alas! how
many called Christians have never learnt it!
A vague acknowledgment that all are sinners, is very
different indeed from the heart's confession, <i>I have
Sinned</i>!  Where repentance has never been known,
oh how weak is faith and how cold is love!  The
sense of sin makes faith look up to a Saviour; the
joy of receiving pardon makes love pour forth her
rich offering of self-sacrifice at His feet.  They love
much who truly feel that they have been forgiven
much.
</p>

<p>
And another lesson had also been learnt by the
quick pupil, the intelligent Afghan child.  With
the bright drops flowing down her cheeks, Sultána
ran up to the wounded men who had been laid on
charpais in the court-yard, ready for the rough
surgery of the barber.  The girl stripped the silver
bracelets from her slender wrists, and silently laid
them beside the bleeding forms of Mir Ghazan and
Ali Khan.  Then slowly, and sadly Sultána
returned to the zenana apartments above to receive
the chastisement which she expected&mdash;not so much
for her mischievous exploit, as for giving away her
jewels.  The poor child had only the comfort of
knowing that she had done what she could in the
way of reparation, and had done it at once.
</p>

<p>
Dermot Denis was somewhat mortified and
ruffled at the result of his interview with Sultána.
She was but a pretty, ignorant savage after all, he
said, and was probably not to be trusted.  He
would rather, he averred, depend for means of
escape on his own courage and skill.  But how even
his powers could effect his purpose was a difficult
problem to solve.  The outer gate was invariably
secured at night, and would form an impassable
barrier.  The court-yard was never quite empty;
or if for a few minutes it appeared to be so, who
could tell how many eyes were looking forth from
the recesses beyond the pillars or the
trellis-covered apertures which probably lighted the
zenana?  Thus on the court-yard side there was
clearly scarcely the faintest chance of escape.  On
the opposite side, where the aperture served as a
window, the precipice seemed to preclude all hope;
unless, indeed, a rope could be procured long
enough, and strong enough to support a man
of some weight as far as a clump of brushwood, from
which, if active, he might possibly clamber down
to more level ground.  How could Denis contrive
to procure such a rope?  He had in the
morning made an attempt to sound Ali Khan on the
subject, having learnt from Walter the Pushtoo
word for a rope, but the young Afghan either could
not or would not understand him.  Ali Khan had
probably too much regard for his own neck to
hazard it by aiding the prisoner's plans; and even
had such not been the case, his present wounded
condition precluded his giving the slightest
assistance.
</p>

<p>
Denis lay awake till past midnight plotting and
planning, resolved to escape in time to stop the
sending of the immense sum of money required by
Assad Khan for his ransom.  The young Irishman
fell at length into a sleep prolonged for hours after
sunrise, and so profound that it was not broken by
sounds which must have startled from slumber
almost anyone but himself.  Denis was so accustomed
to rude noises from the court-yard, that the wildest
uproar would scarcely have roused him.  What the
sounds were will be told in the following chapter.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap12"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br><br>
THE HOUR OF PERIL.
</h3>

<p>
At daybreak there was an arrival in the Eagle's
Nest.  The great gate was opened earlier
than usual to admit a travelling <i>Moulvie</i>.*
Walter, who was as usual an early riser, witnessed
the entrance of the holy man, who was received with
respect.  The Englishman soon saw the effect of the
presence of a religious teacher in the place, one who
had the prestige of a Hajji.**  The Afghans in the
fort had been exceedingly lax in the performance of
the outward forms of their religion; their only
worship had appeared to be that of gold.  There
had been no apparent reading of the Koran; no
Muezzin had sounded the call to prayer.  But now,
as Walter looked down on the court-yard, he saw
prayer-carpets spread, and the Moulvie, with his face
turned towards Mecca, going through the formal
ceremonials which Mohammedanism prescribes.  He
was now on his knees, anon with his forehead touching
the ground, then rising and bowing the orthodox
number of times, whilst some Afghans behind
him imitated the Moulvie's movements, and repeated
after him that which was rather an enumeration of
divine attributes than what we should recognise as
anything like prayer.  The whole ceremony was
almost like a drill exercise, and had as little of true
devotion in it as the movements of soldiers on parade.
And yet these sons of Islam looked upon it as a
means of compounding for their sins; the unscrupulous
robber, the red-handed murderer, was yet a
"true believer," and looked upon paradise as the
reward of his cold and heartless observance of forms.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Religious instructor.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
** One who has performed a pilgrimage to Mecca.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The devotions, such as they were, being ended,
and the carpets removed, the Moulvie retired into
one of the recesses, out of view of Walter, probably
to partake of Afghan hospitality.  Almost in front
of the prison of the Europeans were the charpais on
which were stretched the two Afghans wounded on
the preceding evening, Mir Ghazan and Ali Khan.
The former was asleep; the latter raised his languid
eyes towards the Englishman, for whom he had
formed a liking, and answered with courtesy Walter's
inquiries as to how he had passed the night.  It
appeared evident that the youth's wound, though
painful, was of no dangerous nature.  Ali Khan had
specially enjoyed the singing of Walter, and now he
feebly asked the captive to sing again.  Walter
complied at once, choosing a parable as his theme.
</p>

<p>
The unusual sound brought the Moulvie out of
his dark retreat.  He was a man of repulsive
appearance, with dark stern face, on whose every
lineament seemed to be written bigotry and
pride.
</p>

<p>
"Who is this dog of a Kafir," he cried, "who
dares to lift up his voice in the hearing of true
believers!  Who knows with what venom he is
poisoning the ears of the faithful!  Let him become
a follower of the true Prophet, or die the death of
a dog!  He should be given but the choice between
Islam and the edge of the sword."
</p>

<p>
His loud angry call drew around the Moulvie a
band of Afghans, who looked up towards Walter
with threatening eyes, and hands grasping the hilts
of their daggers.
</p>

<p>
"I know the blasphemies of these Kafirs,"
continued the Moulvie; "I know what is written in
that book which they dare to call the Word of
God."
</p>

<p>
"And which Mohammed Sahib himself acknowledged
to be such," said Walter.  "I, too, have
read the Koran."
</p>

<p>
"Dost dare to answer me, O son of a dog!
devourer of the unclean beast!" exclaimed the
Moulvie, and he began to pour out a volley of
imprecations which could but have the object of
stirring up the ignorant fanatics around him to some
deed of violence.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps there is no being upon earth to whose
heart the life blood would not "thrill with sudden
start" when facing almost immediate death by the
hands of his fellow-creatures.  Walter saw his
enemy's object, and felt that his own life hung on a
thread.  There was an instinct to retreat back as
far as he could, though but into a room whose door
he could not close, as it opened from without; but
a thought of Denis flashed across the prisoner's mind.
Should he draw down the lightning on his friend;
need there be two murders instead of one?  No;
instead of retreating, Walter advanced a step, so
that his foot was on the first round of the ladder;
he then closed the door, and set his back firmly
against it, earnestly praying that the sounds which
must follow might not bring Denis forth to witness
and to share the terrible fate before his companion.
The Englishman's face was very pale, but he
blenched not.
</p>

<p>
The Moulvie also advanced a step.  He raised
his clenched fist, and exclaimed: "I will expose thy
detestable blasphemies, and convict thee out of thine
own mouth.  Whom dost thou say that Isa (Jesus)
the Son of Mary was?"
</p>

<p>
"The Saviour&mdash;my Saviour!" replied Walter.
</p>

<p>
"That is no answer!" cried the Moulvie, with
fierce eagerness to draw his victim to utter the
word which of all others most rouses the bigotry of
the Moslem.  "Tell me but this,&mdash;had He a
Father?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"And who was that Father?&mdash;whose Son was
your Prophet Isa?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>He that confesses Me before men, him will I
also confess before the angels of heaven!</i>" thought
Walter, feeling as if a train of gunpowder were
beneath him, and that he was himself called to
apply the match.
</p>

<p>
"Whose Son was He?" repeated the Moulvie.
</p>

<p>
"The Son of God," replied Walter, with distinct
voice, though a quivering lip.
</p>

<p>
"Down with him! kill him! slay the blasphemer!"
cried the Moulvie; "the path to paradise
is over the corpses of Kafirs!"
</p>

<p>
There was a rush up the ladder staircase, daggers
flashed in the sunlight.  The assailants, on so
narrow a way, cumbered each other's movements;
Walter felt himself struck, but the attempt of the
man behind the foremost ruffian to get in front
by pushing past him partly diverted the blow, and
instead of receiving a mortal wound, Walter, in the
scuffle, was thrown with violence off the ladder
into the court-yard below!
</p>

<p>
It was like falling amongst a herd of yelling
wolves, who would soon have finished their terrible
work, had not at the moment the loud angry voice
of the Afghan chief arrested his followers.  With
naked weapon in his hand, and wrath flashing from
his eyes, Assad Khan strode into the midst of the
throng.
</p>

<p>
"Back, madmen!" he exclaimed.  "Would you
dare to slay the prisoner whom I please to protect,
and rob me of a ransom that will make me the
wealthiest chief in the land of the Afghans!"
</p>

<p>
The would-be murderers shrank back, ashamed
not of their guilt, but their folly.
</p>

<p>
"We want no fire-brands here!" continued the
haughty chief, turning towards the discomfited
Moulvie.  "Go on your journey, and at once.  We
can find our way to paradise well enough without
the aid of such teaching as yours."
</p>

<p>
Walter lay on the ground in violent pain, not so
much from his wounded shoulder as from his ankle,
which had been severely sprained by the fall.
While the chief was angrily repeating his orders for
the summary dismissal of the Moulvie, who was
violently expostulating, and threatening Assad
Khan with the displeasure of all the <i>Pirs</i> whose
tombs the Hajji had visited, two little hands were
placed on Walter's arm, and a trembling voice
exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, have they killed my Feringhee friend!"
</p>

<p>
"No, dear child, it is merely that my ankle is
sprained.  The shoulder is nothing&mdash;a mere flesh-cut,"
said Walter; he bit his lip to keep down the
expression of pain.
</p>

<p>
"It was I who brought my father," whispered
Sultána.  "I had come down with milk for poor
Ali Khan, and I saw that bad Moulvie in such a
fury, and I guessed what was going to happen, so I
ran up the stair to bring help."
</p>

<p>
"You saved my life, Sultána."
</p>

<p>
The child's face brightened with keen delight.
"Do you think that the great Allah sent me to save
you," she asked, "as He sent you to save me from
the cheetah that was carrying me off!"
</p>

<p>
"I have not a doubt that He sent you."
</p>

<p>
"I did not hear Him," said Sultána; "but as I
ran I asked Him to make me run fast, and it was
as if He gave me wings, and I flew,&mdash;I flew!"  The
child spoke with eager excitement; then
softening her tone she added, "I won't forget to
thank Him this time."
</p>

<p>
"Heaven's blessing on you, darling!" exclaimed
Walter, his whole soul going with his words.
</p>

<p>
"Why was the Moulvie so savage?" asked
Sultána; "what did he want you to do?"
</p>

<p>
"To deny my Saviour, the Lord Jesus!  It was
better to die than do that."
</p>

<p>
"Do you love Him so much!" said the child.
</p>

<p>
"Better than life," was the reply.
</p>

<p>
"Will you tell me all about Him?" whispered
the little Afghan; "perhaps you may teach me to
love Him too."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII.
<br><br>
A DARING ATTEMPT.
</h3>

<p>
It may have been simple caprice, or even the
spirit of contradiction, or possibly a more
generous emotion roused by the sight of wrong
done to one who had rescued his child, that made
Assad Khan now treat his wounded captive with
something like kindness.  Whatever was the cause
of the chief's conduct, Walter benefited by the
change.  He was raised from the ground and placed
on a charpai.  The old barber, who in the fort
acted the part of a surgeon, which he did with skill
acquired by much practice, dressed the wound in
the shoulder, bound up the ankle, and applied a
lotion of herbs to reduce the swelling which had
already begun.  A brass vessel filled with milk,
and an abundance of delicious fruit, were brought
for the suffering youth; and with a consideration
which surprised him, some of the contents of his
own plundered carpet-bag, which afforded Walter
the relief of a change of clothes.  Assad Khan asked
his captive whether he preferred remaining below,
or being carried up to the room which he had
occupied with the other Feringhee.  Walter
unhesitatingly chose to return to Denis.  By the
chief's order he was carried up on the charpai, and
over him Assad Khan threw a large and handsome
wrap, something between a rug and a blanket,
acquired&mdash;we need not inquire how.
</p>

<p>
Denis, who had watched the latter part of the
proceedings from the top of the stair, was really
distressed at the sight of his injured friend.  Walter
was gratified at beholding his companion's unfeigned
sorrow, for he saw unbidden tears rising to the
Irishman's eyes.  But when the Afghans who had
carried up the wounded captive had quitted the
room, and the prisoners were left to themselves,
the deepest source of Denis's trouble became apparent.
</p>

<p>
"The most unlucky thing that could have
happened!" he cried.  "You are lamed for ever
so long.  I know what a sprain is, for I had one
when my horse came down in leaping a ditch.  It's
worse than breaking a bone.  You won't be able
for weeks to do more than hop round the
room?"
</p>

<p>
"Not a very wide circle to hop round," observed
Walter with a smile.
</p>

<p>
"No joking matter!" cried Denis impatiently.
"How can you make your escape with me if you
are utterly lame?"
</p>

<p>
"Lame or not, I see no way of either of us
making our escape," observed Walter.
</p>

<p>
"But I do&mdash;at least I will.  Do you think that
I am going to wait here like Patience on a monument
grinning at Afghans, till a ransom is paid that
would make me a beggar?"
</p>

<p>
Walter was too weary to reply.  He felt utterly
exhausted by the effects of his fall.  The youth
fell into a deep sleep which lasted for hours, and
awoke, though still in pain, greatly revived and
refreshed.
</p>

<p>
During the sleep of his comrade, how busy had
been the thoughts of Dermot Denis, what a struggle
had been going on in his mind!  Denis was not
much given to thinking, except in the way of
building castles in the air, or forming ingenious
schemes for accomplishing some plan which he had
taken into his head.  Almost new to him was the
exercise of considering whether what he wished to
do were right or wrong; but his judgment was
forced on that exercise now.  Denis had two courses
open before him, and the one on which his heart
was set would involve an action which his better
nature knew to be base&mdash;desertion of the faithful
and generous friend whom he himself, by his folly
and self-will, had drawn into danger.
</p>

<p>
"Walter is evidently a favourite here; no one
would injure him," said Denis to himself, as he
strode up and down the narrow space of his prison.
"To remain beside him would do him no good.
Were I once in India I could take effectual means
for his rescue.  It is better for him that I should fly."
</p>

<p>
Thus, by arguing with himself, Denis tried to
drown the inward voice of honour&mdash;it could scarcely
be called conscience&mdash;that told him that it would
be cruel and base to leave Walter to the fury of
savages baulked of their golden prize, and that it
was selfishness that prompted the wish to do so.
Denis's most effectual argument was the strength of
his own desire.  What world-wide fame he would
acquire by accomplishing so daring a feat as escaping
from a den of robbers!  What a book of thrilling
adventures he would write, which would not only
be eagerly read in Britain, Ireland, and India, but
would be translated into foreign tongues.  The
title of "Afghanistan Denis," the traveller who
made the wonderful escape from the Eagle's Nest,
would be more gratifying to his pride than could be
the ribbon of the Bath.  Thus reflected Denis, and
he had succeeded in almost persuading himself that
black was white, before Walter awoke from his sleep.
</p>

<p>
"How are you, old boy?" inquired Denis.
</p>

<p>
"Better, very much better.  I cannot be too
thankful to Him who has brought good out of evil.
Denis, I feel such a hope&mdash;&mdash;"  Walter paused,
for he was conscious that he was speaking to one
who had no sympathy with any such hope.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" inquired the Irishman; "I thought
that you always left the hoping to me."
</p>

<p>
"I hope that I have been led here to do some
good to these wild Afghans, and specially to that
most interesting child Sultána."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean that you have been self-appointed
to act as a kind of honorary missionary in the Eagle's
Nest&mdash;a shepherd&mdash;or rather a wolf-herd to a gang
of Afghan robbers?"
</p>

<p>
"God can make use of the weakest instruments,"
said Walter, rather speaking to himself than to
Denis.  "It was certainly a mysterious Providence
that led me here."  Walter was thinking of
the fiery cloudy pillar which he had prayerfully
sought to follow.
</p>

<p>
"If any one can do good here, you will," said
Denis; "the ruffians seem to be amazingly fond of
your singing; you have certainly a capital voice.
Do you think you could give the Afghans a little of
your chanting now?"
</p>

<p>
Walter was surprised at such a proposal coming
from Denis.  He himself felt little equal to any
bodily effort; but his voice was the one talent left
to Walter in his prison, and he desired to use it to
the uttermost for his Master.  The young man let
Denis draw his charpai to a position in front of the
open door, so that Walter, by raising himself to a
sitting posture, commanded a view of the court-yard,
and looked directly down on the two wounded men.
Ali Khan's expression of pleasure at seeing him,
rewarded Walter for the little effort which he had
made.
</p>

<p>
"Leave your blanket with me," said Dermot
Denis.  "The afternoon is so hot, you cannot
possibly want it."  Scarcely waiting for a word of
consent, Denis carried off the wrap to a corner of the
room which was quite out of view of the court-yard.
</p>

<p>
Walter's conduct on the late trying occasion had
made a favourable impression on some of the
Afghans.  He was regarded as a gallant youth, who
had scorned to deny his faith, even with a dagger
at his throat.  Whether that faith were true or
false was a matter of utter indifference to many of
the dwellers in the fort; they knew that Assad
Khan had called the Moulvie&mdash;whatever in Pushtoo
is equivalent to a humbug&mdash;and had turned him
out of the place; what were they that they should
dispute the judgment of their chief?  Thus Walter
began his singing under more favourable auspices
than before, and had a larger circle of listeners.
The prisoner not only chanted the account of the
Prodigal Son, but was able to give a simple practical
exposition of that story which perhaps, of all the
Lord's parables, goes most directly to the listener's
heart.  Pain and weariness were forgotten; Walter
was full of animation; he felt that he was giving the
message of salvation to those who now heard for the
first time that there is a Father in Heaven, ready
to welcome His prodigals home.
</p>

<p>
Young Gurney sang and spoke for more than an
hour; indeed, as long as his strength would hold
out.  An Afghan then came up the stair with a
meal, which was a better one than Assad Khan had
ever before sent to his captives.
</p>

<p>
"Take it from his hands&mdash;don't let the fellow
come in!" cried Denis from his corner.  "Tell him
to close the door; we've had enough of the Afghans
for this day at least."
</p>

<p>
Walter translated the request into Pushtoo; the
food was placed on the charpai, and the door closed,
but not locked.  Walter turned to see why Denis
delayed coming to share the dinner, and beheld with
surprise the occupation in which his comrade was
engaged.
</p>

<p>
Denis had that morning discovered a penknife in
the pocket of Walter's coat, which he wore.  It was
to the Irishman a prize of priceless value.  That
penknife, with patient toil, he had been plying
during the whole of the time that Walter had been
engaged in missionary work.
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing?" exclaimed the astonished
Walter; "cutting my&mdash;or rather the chief's blanket
into strips!"
</p>

<p>
"Hist!  I am preparing a rope."
</p>

<p>
"You are not dreaming of attempting the descent!"
</p>

<p>
"Not dreaming, but resolving and preparing,"
replied Denis, too much engaged&mdash;perhaps too much
ashamed&mdash;to lift up his eyes.
</p>

<p>
Walter was deeply wounded, far more than he
cared to show.  He had already had reason to
know that the former hero of his fancy was a far
less noble being than he had believed him to be;
he saw that Denis was thoughtless and selfish; but
Walter would have indignantly repudiated the idea
of his fellow-captive being able thus to desert a
helpless, suffering friend, had he heard it from any
lips but the Irishman's own.  "<i>Put not your trust
in princes, or in any child of men,</i>" thought
Walter.  "I would not, for all the gold of the
Indies, have left him to bear the consequences of
any flight of mine from this place."
</p>

<p>
"Don't wait dinner for me!" cried Denis; "I
can find my way to my mouth by starlight, but
cannot spare one second of daylight for my work,
for one strip carelessly cut might cost me a broken
neck."
</p>

<p>
"Will your rope be long enough?" asked Walter
curtly.
</p>

<p>
"Thirty-six strips, each six feet long; that will
reach some way down, even allowing for the knots,"
replied Denis.
</p>

<p>
"Can you trust your knots?"
</p>

<p>
"Most perfectly; I am famous for knots, I make
them tighter than even those of wedlock."
</p>

<p>
A long pause of silence followed.  It was broken
by the impatient Denis.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Walter, don't dawdle so over your food;
eat fast, and have done with it.  I could get on
twice as rapidly if you held the cloth whilst I cut
it.  The sun has almost set."
</p>

<p>
Walter did not refuse his help.  Somewhat
gloomily and silently he assisted the Irishman at
his work.  Denis laboured energetically; the strips
were all divided at last, just as it became too dark
to direct the knife.
</p>

<p>
Then came the tying of the knots.  Denis
strained them with all his might to be sure that
they would not slip.  Such work could be done in
semi-darkness.  It was by feeling, not by sight,
that the rope was fastened to the iron hook in the
wall, and first the end, then the remaining length
let down through the window.  During the last
hour scarcely a word had been spoken.
</p>

<p>
"Denis, if you make your way down in safety,
how will you find any path to the road?"
</p>

<p>
"Trust an Irishman for finding his way; it's an
instinct," was the reply.
</p>

<p>
"Will your strength suffice for the journey on
foot?  You are likely to be pursued."
</p>

<p>
"Not till morning, at least," said Denis; "and
to-morrow I shall be safe in India.  I have strength
enough for anything short of carrying off this fort on
my shoulders.  I have, ere now, walked fifty miles
for a wager, and on the second day of our journey,
thanks to that limping mule, we did not go far.
But I'll prepare myself for my long trudge by a
hurried meal ere I start."
</p>

<p>
Denis ate with feverish haste the food which he
could not see.  His dinner was despatched in three
minutes.  What remained he thrust into his pocket.
"Now, I'm ready to be off!" he exclaimed;
"hurrah for freedom and home!"
</p>

<p>
"Dermot," said Walter, earnestly, "we are about
to part, probably never again to meet in this world.
You are bound on a most dangerous journey, and
I&mdash;&mdash;" he cared not to finish the sentence.  "Let
us once more kneel down together, and commend
ourselves, soul and body, to the care of a merciful
God."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I've no time for prayer!" cried Denis,
impatiently; "you pray enough for us both.  Now
for a start!  The first step is what puzzles me
most&mdash;how to get through yon hole, seeing that my
feet must go first, for I must not descend head
downwards.  But where there's a will there's a
way!"
</p>

<p>
To facilitate his climb to the window, Denis
dragged the charpai beneath it; but even when
raised upon this, he could not bring his feet to the
required elevation, though clinging to the rope to
help him.  The unexpected mechanical difficulty
irritated the impetuous young man.
</p>

<p>
"Walter, I must climb on your shoulder."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you will remember that I am wounded,"
said Walter, coldly.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I don't mean your wounded shoulder;
just stand up.  Oh, I forget you are lame&mdash;how
very provoking!  Still you can give me some help."
</p>

<p>
At the cost of much suffering, the help was
given; without it, notwithstanding his agility, and
the desperate efforts which he made, Denis could
not have accomplished his purpose.  With one
foot planted on the unwounded shoulder, maintaining
his balance by means of the rope, Denis contrived
to protrude the other foot through the hole.
To make the first follow it was a feat painfully
hard to accomplish, and every unsuccessful attempt
caused actual agony to Walter.  At length the
long limbs of Denis were in outer air.  But another
annoyance was to be encountered.  The width of
the aperture hardly admitted the passage of shoulders
so broad as those of the young Irishman.  Denis
pushed, struggled, gasped and groaned, sorely
grazing his skin against the rough sides of the hole.
Most terrible indeed would be his fate if he remained
fixed as in a vice, his head and shoulders within the
prison, his feet dangling helplessly in the air.  For
some minutes&mdash;terrible minutes&mdash;Denis was utterly
unable to get in or out.  The drops burst forth on
his brow, as much from the dread that he would
not be able to force his way through, as from the
frantic efforts which he made to do so.  At last&mdash;at
last through the hole which had been so completely
blocked up by the form of Denis as to
leave the room in utter darkness, Walter could see
the stars once more.  There was a head still visible,
then hands clinging to the knotted line; then they
too disappeared&mdash;Dermot Denis was free!
</p>

<p>
Walter listened with breathless attention for any
sound from below.  He heard but the screech of
the owl pursuing his nightly flight; even that
familiar sound made him start.  Then surely there
was something like a crash on the brushwood low
down.  Had Denis reached the bottom of the
descent?  Walter had no means of judging by
sight, but he got hold of the rope not far from the
hook, and by pulling it ascertained that it was
hanging loose, not strained tight by the weight of
a man.  Dermot must either have climbed down
or have fallen,&mdash;which?
</p>

<p>
"Better unloose the knot now, and throw down
the rope after him, that no clue remain as to how
he made his escape," thought Walter.
</p>

<p>
He could not unloose the knot, but groped in the
dark for the penknife.  Walter's sprained ankle
made every movement painful.  The penknife was
found at last, left open on the floor by Denis.
Walter, standing on the charpai, cut the knot which
he could not untie, and the end of the rope which
had been fastened to it was drawn through the hole
by the weight of the rest.
</p>

<p>
Walter could now do no more but prepare his
soul by prayer, and his body by rest, for whatever
the morrow might bring.  He was engaged in fervent
devotion, when a rude tramping on the stair
and the sound of voices broke the stillness of
midnight.  The door was roughly thrown open.  At
the hour when he was least expected, Assad Khan,
attended by men bearing torches, and one small form
gliding noiselessly behind, entered the prisoners'
room.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br><br>
SPEAK OR DIE!
</h3>

<p>
It is necessary to explain the cause of Assad
Khan's most unexpected appearance.
</p>

<p>
The chief was holding late revels that
night, to celebrate some relative's betrothal, when
a loud and continued call at the gate announced
that some one wanted admittance.  The great iron
key hung at the girdle of Assad Khan, for he never
at night trusted it into any hands but his own.
Such precaution was deemed necessary in that land
of treachery and sudden surprises.  Followed by
those who had been sharing his banquet, Assad
Khan stalked to the massive gate.  The call for
admittance had excited the curiosity of the females
of his family, who, in their upper apartments, were
having a feast of their own.  Sultána, to whom
childhood gave freedom of action, came down to
behold and report.
</p>

<p>
The gate was not unclosed till it was ascertained
that he who claimed admittance was Attili Ullah, a
trusted servant of the chief, who had been chosen as
his messenger to convey the letter of Dermot Denis
to the official in India.
</p>

<p>
On being admitted, the Afghan fell at the feet
of Assad Khan, and told his story.  He spun it out to
some length, with a great many appeals to the Holy
Being whose name is so lightly taken by Moslems.
But the story itself may be given in very few words.
In fording a river Attili's foot had slipped, he had
been well-nigh drowned, and the precious letter
which was to have brought such heaps of rupees
had been lost!
</p>

<p>
Assad Khan was angry, and the poor messenger
narrowly escaped a flogging as well as drowning.
Assad Khan thought, however, that the delay of a
few days was all the harm that had been done.  If
the yellow-haired one, as he called the Irishman,
had written one letter, he was at hand to write
another, and a second messenger should start with
it at once.  It was this that brought to the prison
at midnight the unwelcome visitors who now
thronged it.
</p>

<p>
"Where is he?  Where is the yellow-haired?"
exclaimed Assad Khan, gazing around in surprise
at finding only Walter within.
</p>

<p>
"Where is he?" echoed the wondering attendants.
</p>

<p>
Walter had resolved to answer no questions.
Every minute's delay was, he felt, important, as
giving to Dermot Denis a better chance of escape.
</p>

<p>
"Where is the Kafir dog?" exclaimed the furious
chief, when no doubt remained that the prisoner
had vanished indeed.
</p>

<p>
Not a word from the lips of Walter.
</p>

<p>
"Who saw him last?" roared out the chief; "who
brought the food which I sent more early than
usual?"
</p>

<p>
"I took it," answered an Afghan.
</p>

<p>
"Was the yellow-haired here?  Did you see him?"
</p>

<p>
"I did not see him, for he," pointing to Walter,
"took the food from my hand, and I did not enter
the room."
</p>

<p>
Several voices spoke at once; they bore witness
that the yellow-haired had been in the room when
Walter was carried in on the charpai; but nothing
had been seen of him since.
</p>

<p>
"Then it may have been many hours since he
passed through the court-yard; and he could not pass
without being seen!" exclaimed the indignant chief.
"Ali Khan and Mir Ghazan at least must have seen
him.  If there has been treachery,&mdash;if the Feringhee
has bribed with his gold,&mdash;the vengeance of
Assad shall fall on the traitors."  Then suddenly
turning again towards Walter, he cried, "You must
know how and when he fled.  Dog, speak! or I'll
force out the secret by torture!"
</p>

<p>
Walter pressed his white lips closely together;
not a sound came forth.
</p>

<p>
"Bind him and bastinado him, till he speak or die!"
</p>

<p>
The state of Walter's ankle, so inflamed that
even a touch gave pain, made the command most
barbarous; every blow on that foot would be
torture indeed.  The unhappy youth could but
inwardly pray that strength might be given to
bear what he felt that unaided human nature
could not endure.  But no compassion for the
sufferer was heard in any Afghan heart there&mdash;but
one.  Sultána did not weep, nor cling to her
father's knees; child as she was, she knew that to
do so would be of no avail whatever&mdash;she might
as well try by tears to melt a stone; like a
young fawn she bounded forward&mdash;one little bare
foot just touching the charpai gave impetus to
her spring.  Sultána was in the window aperture
in a moment, and cried out in a tone of defiance&mdash;"If
you touch him, I'll throw myself over the
cliff."
</p>

<p>
"Sultána, come down!" cried her father; "I
will wring the secret out of the Kafir!"
</p>

<p>
"But if <i>I</i> can tell it?"&mdash;and what a bright face,
bending down from the aperture, was seen by the
torchlight! "what if the little Eagle knows how
the yellow-haired fled!"
</p>

<p>
"Thou! speak, child!" cried the chief, in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"You will not hurt my friend if I tell all?"
</p>

<p>
"I have no wish to hurt him," was the reply,
"if I can but get back again into my grasp the
wealthy Feringhee.  This youth is poor as a
wandering fakir."
</p>

<p>
"The yellow-haired fled this way&mdash;by this opening,"
cried Sultána; "he must have had an eagle's
wings, indeed, if he got to the bottom unharmed."
</p>

<p>
"How knowest thou that he escaped by the window?"
</p>

<p>
"He left a bit of his coat behind on this stone!"
cried the intelligent child, triumphantly exhibiting
a fragment of the garment which Denis had torn
in his struggle to get through the hole, and which
her hand had accidentally touched.
</p>

<p>
"After him, and seize him!" cried the chief.
</p>

<p>
There needed no second command.  Like hounds at
the sound of the wild halloo, the Afghans rushed from
the room, knocking one another over in their eagerness
to descend the staircase-ladder.  The chief followed
almost as quickly, remembering what his men had
forgotten, that he had the key at his girdle, by
means of which alone they could pass through the
gate to commence their midnight search, after
descending the hill on whose summit the hill was
built.
</p>

<p>
Sultána sprang down from the window.  Walter
heard her voice, as clasping her little hands she
exclaimed, "Allah!  Sultána thanks Thee!  Thou
hast sent her to save her Feringhee again!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV.
<br><br>
THE KNOTTED ROPE.
</h3>

<p>
We must return to Dermot Denis, clinging to
his rope, and descending on his perilous
way.
</p>

<p>
Dangerous it was, that he knew; but his bold and
buoyant spirit was full of hope, as soon as by violent
effort he had succeeded in squeezing his body through
the window.  He clambered down as rapidly as he
could, for the doubt soon forced itself on his mind
whether his arms, whose muscles were unaccustomed
to that peculiar kind of effort, could support the
weight of his body for any great length of time.
The knots were in one way a help, affording small
projections for the feet; but they made it impossible
for the rope to slip rapidly through his hands, as
cordage through those of a sailor.  Denis intuitively
counted them as he passed them; each knot
was a step towards freedom, but their number was
appalling.  Denis had, he knew, made two hundred
and fifteen knots; his arms ached before he had
passed twenty.  He could dimly distinguish the
outline of the top of the fort cutting the blue sky
above him; if he attempted to glance downwards,
there was nothing but darkness beneath&mdash;he seemed
to be descending into unfathomable space!  Down,
down, down!  Eighty knots were passed; the
tension of the muscles now was agony, but Denis did
not dare to let go.  He could hardly even guess
how far he was from the bottom; he was alarmed to
see how small a space he seemed to have placed
between himself and the top.  The climber feared
that he could not have gone half the distance, and
he was as one on the rack!  Desperately the bold
Irishman held on his way; ninety-seven, ninety-eight,
ninety-nine, then he felt the knot which he
now grasped not like the rest; it was slipping&mdash;giving
way&mdash;oh horror! the next moment the
unfortunate Denis was dashed to the bottom!
With characteristic carelessness he had not fully
tested one knot,&mdash;<i>only one</i>,&mdash;and that carelessness
cost him his life!
</p>

<p>
Low down amongst the brushwood, where no
human foot ever had trodden, lay the mangled,
broken corpse of the unfortunate Denis.  No time
to pray, he had said ere he started; he had thrown
away his last opportunity; oh, had he but known
that it was his last!
</p>

<p>
Denis had never deliberately rejected religion;
he had, as has been said, never disgraced himself by
indulging in any gross vice.  Selfishness and self-will
were his bane, and he had never looked upon them
as sins; he had never thought that they imperilled
his soul.  Denis had never paused to consider, as
he formed his life-rope of pleasures and plans, that
he was in truth hanging over an abyss, into which
a mere accident might precipitate him for ever!
</p>

<p>
O reader! pause for a few moments and
consider your own state in the sight of God.  My
little book may not be in the hands of the openly
wicked and profane, but is it now in the hands of
the self-willed and selfish?  Honestly ask a
question of your conscience&mdash;"Is my eye watching
the fiery cloudy pillar? is the will of my God, and
not my own, <i>habitually</i> directing my movements?
Do I do nothing without seeking direction from on
high, and if that direction lead to what seems a
desert, am I ready to follow it without hesitation?"  This
is taking up the cross, this is following fully
the Lord who <i>pleased not Himself</i>.
</p>

<p>
What would have been the fate of an Israelite
who, when the heavenly pillar moved on, should
have wilfully lingered in some tempting oasis, under
the shade of the date trees?  He would have lost
the <i>manna</i>, he would have lost the <i>water</i> which,
gushing from the smitten rock, supplied the wants
of the host.  He might for a-while have drunk from
an earthly well, and enjoyed the shade and the
fruit, but they would not have really satisfied, and
must have failed him at last.
</p>

<p>
Do not turn lightly away from my warning, do
not throw away the book, or quickly turn over its
pages to find something more pleasant; I would
plead with you heart to heart, my brother or sister,
in this still hour in which I am writing in the dim
twilight before sunrise.  Look into your own heart
and see what occupies the central place within it.
Is it the <i>Saviour</i>, or <i>self</i>.  In your common habits,
your round of daily occupations, is your thought,
"This pleases me," or "Would it please my holy
Lord?"  However innocent may be your amusements,
however useful your occupations, however
attractive you may be to those around you, if you
form your own course according to your own will,
you are trusting your safety to a rope which must
break, your immortal soul is in peril.  Down on
your knees, ask for the eye of Faith to see the
guiding Pillar; ask for the foot of obedience to
follow wherever it lead; pray for the spirit of love
to Christ to triumph over self-love; and doubt not
that the light before you will shine forth more and
more unto the fulness of joy.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI.
<br><br>
AFTER SEVEN YEARS.
</h3>

<p>
We will now pass over seven long years, only
lightly glancing at events which
immediately followed that recorded in the
preceding chapter.
</p>

<p>
The lifeless body of the unhappy Denis was
found by the Afghans before morning.  Great was
the disappointment of Assad Khan and his followers
to find their prisoner dead.  Not only were their
hopes of a large ransom lost, but they were sorely
afraid that the heavy hand of the English Government
would come down upon them and crush them,
in revenge for the supposed murder of their captive.
</p>

<p>
"The yellow-haired was a great Amir, a man of
mighty wealth, as a prince amongst the Feringhees!"
exclaimed Assad Khan.  "If it be known that he
perished here, there will be a blood-feud between
us and the lords of India.  They will send an army
over the border, and destroy the Eagle's Nest, slay
every man that they find, and hang me up with
shame and disgrace!  He who offends the Feringhees
rouses up a tiger who tears and devours.  It must
never be known that those two Kafirs crossed my
threshold."
</p>

<p>
Walter was in the eyes of the Afghans poor and
of little account.  It was not supposed that any
great search would be made, or large ransom offered
for him.  He must be kept a close prisoner, and
the fact of his having entered the fort remain a
profound secret; for, were it known that the one
Feringhee was there, the fate of the other would be
traced to Assad Khan, and fearful vengeance overtake
the chief and all his tribe.
</p>

<p>
The disappearance of Dermot Denis, though not
noticed for a few days, did indeed excite much
attention in India, though newspapers at first only
told of the adventurous traveller who had, unknown to
Government, crossed the border, and for whose safety
apprehensions were entertained.  After a-while
apprehensions increased&mdash;not by tales spread
by the muleteers, for those unfortunate men had
not been suffered to reach India alive, but by the
absence of all reliable intelligence of the Irishman
and his companion.
</p>

<p>
Then Government took up the matter.  A large
reward was offered, and investigations commenced.
MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE OF TWO ENGLISHMEN
appeared in capitals in every paper, and in mess-room,
at dinner-table, in ball-room, the probable
fate of the bold adventurers formed a common topic
of conversation.  But reward offered, and search
made were alike unavailing; and other subjects of
newer interest took the place of that which at first
had been the topic on every tongue.
</p>

<p>
Denis's relations in Ireland were at first in great
trouble about him.  His sisters shed floods of tears,
his brothers talked of going out themselves to India
to prosecute the strictest search.  But time wore
away the edge of their sorrow.  Again the girls
danced at the county balls, and enjoyed their
picnics and lawn-tennis.  The elder of the brothers,
in due time, succeeded to the family property;
there were hunting and shooting in the fields,
revelry and mirth in the mansion whose former
master had not even a grave!  Poor Dermot was
almost forgotten; even his name was seldom
mentioned&mdash;unless some stranger looking up at the
full-length portrait, by an eminent artist, of a
gentleman in hunting costume, should chance to
inquire, "Who is that splendid-looking young
man?"  "Oh! poor Dermot, the best fellow in
the world&mdash;lost in Afghanistan," would be the reply,
carelessly given, and immediately, perhaps, followed
by a request to pass round the bottle.  It is only
for a while that the fall of even the largest stone
into a lake leaves eddies to tell where it fell.  The
world's darling passes away, and the thoughtless
world laughs on.
</p>

<p>
Seven years had passed since Denis on his steed,
and Walter trudging as his squire on foot, had
traversed the mountain road, when a British force,
invading Afghanistan, encamped close by the thicket
where Sultána had encountered the leopard.
Hundreds of camels were crouching on the ground,
relieved for a-while from their burdens; hundreds of
mules were tethered by the tents.  The blare of the
bugle, the word of command, the confused noises of
a camp resounded in the lately silent pass, and the
sunbeams glinted back from bayonet and sword.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "To hero bound for battle strife,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or bard of martial lay,<br>
  'Twere worth ten years of peaceful life<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One glance at their array."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
A commissariat-officer, burdened with the care of
providing for the host, was standing by one of the
tents, pencil and note-book in hand, engaged in
making some calculation regarding fodder and
forage, when he was approached by a stranger of
very striking and prepossessing appearance.  The
Afghan costume set off to advantage a tall and
graceful figure, but the countenance and manner
were unmistakeably those of an English gentleman.
The officer looked up in surprise as he was courteously
saluted by the stranger, whose face expressed
the emotion naturally felt by one who, after an
absence of many years, finds himself again in the
midst of his countrymen.
</p>

<p>
"Whom have I the pleasure of seeing in Afghan
disguise?" asked the British officer.
</p>

<p>
"You are hardly likely, sir, to know a name
which its owner has half-forgotten.  Seven years
ago I was called Walter Gurney."
</p>

&quot;'Ha! the companion of Dermot Denis the traveller!' exclaimed <br>
the officer. 'What a search was made for you both!'&quot;
</p>

<p>
"Ha! the companion of Dermot Denis the
traveller!" exclaimed the officer, as he cordially
grasped his countryman's hand.  "What a search
was made for you both!  What has become of Mr. Denis?"
</p>

<p>
"My unhappy friend died long ago," replied
Walter gravely.  "He was killed by a fall down a
precipice, when trying to make his escape."
</p>

<p>
"Poor fellow! poor fellow!" said the officer.
"This meeting is most interesting.  I must
introduce you to our Colonel; I will take you at once
to his tent."
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me, sir, but I would rather be introduced
to your Chaplain, if there be one with the
forces."
</p>

<p>
"Here he comes," said the officer, as a missionary
acting as chaplain approached the spot, attracted by
the sight of a European in Afghan costume.
"Mr. Coldstream, let me introduce you to Mr. Gurney, a
gentleman who was supposed to have been murdered
many years ago by the savage Pathans."
</p>

<p>
The chaplain warmly shook hands with Walter,
and congratulated him on his marvellous escape.
"Where have you been? how have you been
permitted to join us? how have you been treated?"
were questions eagerly asked.
</p>

<p>
"I shall have time to reply as we walk together,"
said Walter Gurney, "if you, sir, will grant a
great favour which I have specially come to ask.
Will you spare us two or three hours of your time,
and trust yourself to my guidance up a somewhat
difficult mountain path?  I will be answerable for
your safety."
</p>

<p>
"For what reason do you wish me to go?" asked
the Chaplain in some surprise.
</p>

<p>
Walter's sunburnt face flushed with pleasure as
he replied, "A little flock, seven individuals, are
anxiously expecting your coming to admit them,
by baptism, into the fold of the Christian
Church."
</p>

<p>
The Chaplain's exclamation of surprise was echoed
by several Englishmen whom curiosity had drawn
around.
</p>

<p>
"You don't mean Afghans!" cried the commissariat-officer.
</p>

<p>
"I do mean Afghans," replied Walter, smiling.
"There are four women and three men in a fort on
yonder height, quite ready to become members of a
Christian community."
</p>

<p>
"I should expect bears and wolves to become
Christians before Pathans," laughed a young ensign,
who was not a Christian himself.
</p>

<p>
"Time is precious," said Walter, turning to the
Chaplain and gently pressing his point; "I would
not have you descend a difficult road in darkness.
We can offer you refreshment above.  I should be
very grateful, Mr. Coldstream, if you could come
with me at once."
</p>

<p>
"We'll come in a party!" cried the merry ensign;
"one does not come across such an adventure as this
every day."
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me, sir," said Walter, courteously but
firmly; "a British uniform would create suspicion
and alarm.  Not many of our mountaineers have
embraced the Christian faith, and most of them
barely tolerate its profession.  I promised that I
would bring a clergyman, if I could find one&mdash;but
bring him alone."
</p>

<p>
"This is really a foolhardy proceeding,
Mr. Coldstream," expostulated an elder officer; "you
are not likely to be suffered to come back
alive."
</p>

<p>
"I assure you, sir, that there is no danger, or
none that would weigh a grain in the balance with
a labourer for Christ," said Walter Gurney.  "Two
of those who are candidates for baptism in the fort
are the chief and his wife."
</p>

<p>
"A miracle! a miracle!" exclaimed the ensign.
</p>

<p>
"I think that I can be answerable for Mr. Coldstream's
returning within three hours," persisted
Walter.
</p>

<p>
"And I hope that you will return with him,"
cried one of the officers present.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I am anxious to avail myself of this
opportunity of returning to India," replied Walter.
"Not that I have any intention of deserting my
Afghan friends; but I wish to prepare myself by
study for ordination, that I may be qualified to act
as their pastor."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you'll think better than that!" cried the
ensign, shrugging his shoulders and turning on his
heel.
</p>

<p>
"Once out of the trap, you'll hardly walk back
into it with your eyes open," said the commissariat-officer
with a smile, as Walter, accompanied by the
Chaplain, started for the fort.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII.
<br><br>
A RICH REWARD.
</h3>

<p>
Walter, with the eagerness of one who has
succeeded in an object on which his heart
has been set, was impatient to reach the
Eagle's Nest; but he had to slacken his pace to suit
a companion not accustomed, like himself, to ascend
mountains with almost the agility of the chamois.
The way was often too narrow to admit of the two
men walking abreast; but, in other parts, its
comparative breadth permitted conversation between
them.  Mr. Coldstream heard, with great interest,
particulars of the fate of poor Dermot Denis.
</p>

<p>
"I never saw a man with a finer <i>physique</i>," he
observed; and then, glancing at the noble form and
fine face of his guide, he mentally added "but
one."
</p>

<p>
For the slender, delicate-looking youth had
developed into a powerful man, with mustachio on
lip, and beard on chin,&mdash;one so altered and improved
in appearance that those who had known him seven
years before would scarcely have recognised him.
The turban which Walter wore surmounted features
regular and aristocratic, to which the singularly
animated and intelligent hazel eyes gave character
and expression.
</p>

<p>
"I am surprised that during all the years that
you have passed in the mountains, you have never
communicated the fact of your existence to friends
in India," remarked the Chaplain.
</p>

<p>
"I could not, though most anxious to do so,"
replied Walter.  "I was a kind of prisoner on parole.
Had I not pledged my honour as an Englishman to
do nothing of the kind, I should have been chained
up, as a dog, by the chief."
</p>

<p>
"And how were you released from your promise?"
</p>

<p>
"I was released by the death of the chief, Assad
Khan, which occurred not many weeks ago," replied
Walter.  "His relative and successor is a Christian,
one whom I shall have the joy of presenting to you
to-day."
</p>

<p>
"And have you indeed, in this most wild and
weed-choked corner of the mission-field, been
privileged to gather in seven sheaves?" asked the
Chaplain.
</p>

<p>
"Not through my efforts were the seven brought
in," replied Walter with a smile.  "The first convert
made the more successful missionary.  She was the
means of winning for Christ her husband, her
grandmother, and two female friends."
</p>

<p>
"What, a woman&mdash;and an Afghan!" exclaimed
the Chaplain.
</p>

<p>
"A woman with the ardour of a Martha, and the
faith of a Mary; an Afghan&mdash;with her naturally
proud spirit softened and subdued by the love of
Christ which constraineth."
</p>

<p>
"Most wonderful!" ejaculated the Chaplain.
</p>

<p>
"Dear sir," said Walter Gurney, "if we could
have seen the painted savages who roamed in old
times through our Britain, with their rude idols and
barbarous rites, we might have thought that the
Afghan suffers little by comparison with his brothers
in the West.  What is it that has made old England
glorious and free but the Gospel? and what
does Afghanistan need but the Gospel to make her
the same!"
</p>

<p>
Walter spoke with the enthusiasm of one who
has devoted seven of the best years of his life to
the evangelisation of a despised race, and who sees
of what that race is capable.
</p>

<p>
"You must have encountered immense difficulties,"
observed Mr. Coldstream, after a break in the
conversation, caused by the extreme steepness of the
rocky way, which at this part necessitated actual
climbing.
</p>

<p>
"I could never have surmounted them in my
own strength," said Walter.  "When I look back,
it is as I see that you are now doing, on the path
which we have traversed,&mdash;wondering how I ever
was enabled to gain the point which I have reached.
God has led me step by step."
</p>

<p>
"And are your robbers actually transformed into
anything like Christians?" inquired Mr. Coldstream.
</p>

<p>
"I own that some of the converts remind me
of Lazarus, when called from the grave; they are
living, but with their grave-clothes clinging around
them.  It is difficult to persuade men to whom
theft has been a profession, and revenge a virtue,
that these are sins to be repented of and forsaken.
I have been under a great disadvantage; I have
only had the New Testament with me; for whatever
related to the older Scriptures I have had to
trust my memory."
</p>

<p>
"This has been a serious disadvantage, indeed,"
said the missionary.  "The law is our schoolmaster
to bring us to Christ; both Jew and Christian have
had its teachings from childhood, and even where
conversion has not followed, it has raised the moral
tone.  To the heathen and Moslem we preach
Christ crucified, and we do well, for the very sum
and substance of the Gospel is contained in these
two blessed words.  But this seed of Truth, when
received by those previously ignorant of the requirements
of God's holy law, often springs up as I have
seen an early crocus in England, when called forth
by the beams of the sun, from ground on which
snow still lingers.  There is the bright blossom, and
its very existence proves that it has a root; but it
is destitute of leaves or stalk.  Thus its beauty is
often marred, and its purity soiled by earth."
</p>

<p>
"I see your meaning," said Walter, "and my
own small experience confirms it.  There is the
flower of love, the root of faith; but the strong
upright stem of conscientiousness appears to be
wanting."
</p>

<p>
"It is on account of this," observed Mr. Coldstream,
"that amongst converts from heathenism
there is often conversion without any deep conviction
of sin,&mdash;without the knowledge of the law we
know not what sin is.  In England, when the
drunkard, the blasphemer, or the thief is brought to
the light, his first feeling is usually horror at the
blackness of his own sins.  He abhors himself, and
pours out his soul in penitent sorrow; he regards
himself as a brand plucked from the burning, and
dreads the flames of sin in which he so nearly has
perished.  As far as my experience goes, this deep
sense of guilt is rare in our converts.  The heart is
touched, but not the conscience.  They who have
never listened to the thunders of Sinai have the
love of Christ, but the fear of God is wanting.  The
missionary can no more leave such converts to
themselves, than a mother can leave her babe.  He
rejoices at first in their simple faith, he thanks God
for a new-born soul&mdash;till startled by some strange
inconsistency which makes him, perhaps, doubt that
faith, and fear that spiritual life itself is wanting.
The pendulum of his feelings then may sway from
the one extreme of excessive hope, into the
opposite&mdash;and more dangerous one&mdash;of discouragement, if
not despair."
</p>

<p>
"And what should the missionary learn from
this painful experience?" asked Walter.
</p>

<p>
"Much patience, much watchfulness, and much
prayer.  Patience with those who never in childhood
had the clear outlines which divide right and
wrong marked out before their eyes&mdash;those who
have breathed, as it were, a polluted atmosphere
from their earliest days, and are therefore scarcely
sensible of its evil.  Watchfulness, to guard the
weak ones as far as possible from temptation, and,
by careful teaching, try to supply the want of early
training.  With these, earnest prayer for the Holy
Spirit, who alone can purify the human heart&mdash;that
long desecrated and polluted temple."
</p>

<p>
"How refreshing it is to talk over these difficulties
with one who has experienced, and can
therefore enter into them fully!" cried Walter.
"As regards all human help, I have been so utterly
alone; I have had to teach when I myself required
to learn.  I feel more strongly than ever the
necessity of leaving my Afghan children for a-while,
to become by study, and intercourse with the
experienced, a less unworthy shepherd of souls."
</p>

<p>
The companions had now come within sight of
the fort, which was not visible from a distance, but
which nestled, as it were, between steep crags,
partly clothed with brushwood.
</p>

<p>
"Most picturesquely situated!" exclaimed Mr. Coldstream.
</p>

<p>
"Its name of Eagle's Nest suits it well," observed
Walter.  "You see a party of Afghans thronging
round the gate to receive us."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; and they look as if they were eagles with
sharp claws and beaks," said the Chaplain, surveying
the wild and not altogether friendly-looking group
through which he was to pass.  For the first time
Mr. Coldstream doubted his own prudence in coming amongst them.
</p>

<p>
"Mustapha Khan! why have you brought your
gun?  You know that it is against orders," said
Walter sternly; and with a wave of his hand he
sent the offender to the rear.
</p>

<p>
"I should doubt <i>that</i> eagle being turned into a
dove," observed Mr. Coldstream, as he passed through
the gate.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mustapha has given some trouble," said Walter.
</p>

<p>
"And will give more, I suspect," added the Chaplain.
</p>

<p>
But the sight that met his eyes in the courtyard
put from the missionary's mind all thoughts
but those of surprise and joy.  Around the well
stood the candidates for baptism; the men on one
side, the women on the other; the latter arrayed
in white.  Sultána was there in her radiant beauty,
the bud expanded to the beautiful rose, supporting
her aged silver-haired grandmother, whose face
expressed the peace which the spirit had found,
the light which at even-time had shone upon her
soul.  Two shy-looking women stood rather in the
back-ground, shrinking from the gaze of a stranger.
Opposite was Ali Khan, with two companions.  The
young chief came forward to greet the Chaplain
with a frank friendliness which made Mr. Coldstream
reproach himself for having for a moment
entertained doubts.
</p>

<p>
"Welcome to the Eagle's Nest," cried the chief;
"welcome in the name of the Lord!"
</p>

<p>
"Will you question the candidates?" suggested
Walter.  "I will translate for you sentence by
sentence."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Coldstream's questions were few, and entirely
confined to the men&mdash;save, when turning towards
Sultána, he asked simply, "Do you love the Lord
Jesus?  Do you look for salvation only through
Him?"  The beaming look on the lovely countenance
of the chieftain's wife, as she gave her brief
reply, was, as the Chaplain afterwards said, like the
smile on an angel's face.
</p>

<p>
With varied expressions on their swarthy features,
the yet unconverted Afghans looked on as the holy
service of baptism was performed before them.
Curiosity was perhaps the most prevalent feeling;
but here and there a Moslem was seen scowling
with undisguised displeasure.  Once or twice the
Chaplain's ear caught an angry murmur of "Kafir!"
but there was no open opposition.  The missionary
thought of the lion-tamer in his cage of wild beasts,
and wondered at the power by which a single
unarmed man had been able to subdue or overawe
such savage natures.
</p>

<p>
The simple rite was now over; Ali Khan and
his companions were now welcomed as members of
Christ's visible Church upon earth.  The Chaplain's
heart was warm within him, but his pleasure was
small compared to that of Walter.  In the scene of
former sufferings and perils, the young evangelist
tasted what is perhaps the most exquisite draught
of joy which is given to man on earth, for it is a
foretaste of heaven itself.  Who can tell the bliss
expressed in the words,&mdash;"<i>Lo, I and the children
whom Thou hast given me.</i>"  That hour gave to
Walter for all his past difficulties, trials, and
dangers "an overpayment of delight."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Coldstream, seated on a charpai overspread
with a leopard's skin, partook of some refreshment
prepared and brought by Sultána herself, Walter,
Ali Khan, and the two Christian men sharing the
meal.  Mr. Coldstream admired the simple modest
grace of the chieftain's wife, but remarked to
Walter that she looked dejected.
</p>

<p>
"She feels&mdash;we all feel&mdash;the coming parting,"
was Walter's reply; "needful it is, but painful.
I have had considerable difficulty in obtaining the
chief's consent to my departure."
</p>

<p>
The hospitable meal was soon concluded.
Mr. Coldstream could not linger long in the Eagle's
Nest; the road being so difficult, he wished to
retrace his steps before night.
</p>

<p>
"I must not, however, leave the fort," said the
clergyman, "without seeing the prison from which
poor Dermot Denis tried to make his escape."
</p>

<p>
Walter led the way up the ladder-staircase so
often mentioned, into what had been his former
prison.
</p>

<p>
"This is still my room," he observed, as he
entered the small apartment, clean, but very
scantily furnished.  "I have made but few alterations,
except that of transferring the strong lock
from the outside to the inside of the door.  I have
now the advantage of being able to shut out
intruders, instead of being myself locked in."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Coldstream went up to the aperture through
which poor Denis had passed to his doom, and
shuddered as he looked down through it on the
precipice below.
</p>

<p>
"What an act of daring&mdash;or rather of madness&mdash;to
attempt such a descent!" he exclaimed.  "The
idea of it renders one dizzy!"
</p>

<p>
"My poor friend was one who never knew fear!"
observed Walter, and he sighed as he remembered
the heroic, noble-looking horseman in whose
company he had first entered the country of the
Afghans.
</p>

<p>
In silence the two Englishmen quitted the room
and descended into the court-yard.  They found it
crowded, not only by the inmates of the fort, but
by Afghans who dwelt in scattered hamlets, but
still belonged to the clan, and paid allegiance to its
chief.
</p>

<p>
The time for parting had arrived.  Walter
could not quit a place where he had done and
suffered so much, nor the spiritual children whom
he loved, without a sore pang of regret.  First in a
few soul-stirring words he exhorted the Afghans to
maintain their fidelity to Ali Khan, and stand by
him, through weal or woe.  Walter then turned
towards the brave chief, and, after the manner of
the country, locked him in a hearty embrace.
</p>

<p>
"The Lord be with you, and bless you, brother! and
be your strong rock and fortress!" he cried.
</p>

<p>
"And bring you back to us soon!" exclaimed
the chief.
</p>

<p>
"Mirza, you also are one of us," said Walter to
another of the newly baptised; and embracing him
the young evangelist added, "let my parting words
to you be the exhortation of our Lord to His
disciples&mdash;<i>Watch and pray that ye fall not into
temptation.</i>"
</p>

<p>
"You may trust me," said the Afghan; "my
faith is as strong as my sword."
</p>

<p>
"Mir Ghazan, my friend," and again Walter's
arms enfolded a burly-looking Afghan, "never
forget the promise&mdash;<i>Be thou faithful unto death and
I will give thee a crown of life.</i>"
</p>

<p>
Mir Ghazan responded to the embrace, but
uttered no word in reply.
</p>

<p>
Then Walter turned to the aged woman, and
reverentially raised the withered hand to his lips.
"Bless me, mother," he said, gently; "<i>the hoary
head is a crown of glory</i>.  We shall meet, if not in
this world, in a better."  The old widow melted
into tears.
</p>

<p>
Oriental propriety forbade even a parting pressure
of the hand between the Englishman and the
younger women.  But Sultána followed her spiritual
guide as far as the gate, there to bid him farewell.
She did not weep, but her pale cheek and quivering
lip betrayed her emotion on the departure of him
to whom she owed life, and what she valued much
more than life.
</p>

<p>
"The God who guided you here, and guarded
you here, and made you a blessing to us all, be
with you wherever you go!" she faltered.  Sultána
added in a softer tone, "You will not forget
your Afghan children when far, far away?"
</p>

<p>
"Forget you, Sultána? never! night and day my
prayers will rise for you all."
</p>

<p>
"And you will come back to the Eagle's Nest?"
said Sultána, with a sad, wistful look in her blue
eyes, as she raised them to Walter's face.
</p>

<p>
"God permitting, I will surely come back," said
Walter.  He could not trust his voice to say more,
but turned and rapidly strode down the hill in
silence, which the sympathising Chaplain did not
attempt to break.  He noticed that Ali Khan and
some of the Afghans were following at a little
distance, to see the last of their English friend.
</p>

<p>
At the last point from which the Eagle's Nest
was visible from the road, Walter Gurney paused,
turned, and looked up.  On the roof of the fort, in
her white garments, stood Sultána; a cloud
crimsoned with the sunset glow behind her head showed
like a glory.  It would hardly have seemed strange
had white wings expanded behind her.
</p>

<p>
"A child of light!" murmured Walter Gurney.
He stood still for a few moments as if fixed to the
spot; not another word passed his lips, but his soul
was pouring forth his silent thanksgiving.  How
marvellously had the fiery pillar, of which that
cloud reminded him, led him through the dark
night of affliction, suffering, and danger!  His
trials had turned into blessings; his troubles had
worked together for lasting good.  Walter Gurney
had left memorials behind him on his pilgrim-path
through the desert, living stones of priceless value
that should, through all eternity, find a place in
the heavenly city above.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII.
<br><br>
NOONTIDE GLARE.
</h3>

<p>
What marvellous transformation scenes we
behold in Nature!  One day we look on
the ocean, a seething mass of turbulent
waters, leaden-tinted, save where the angry wind
lashes it into foam; the next day a fair expanse of
blue lies before us, scarcely dimpled with even a
ripple, and sparkling in sunshine!  Lingering
winter has made some landscape dreary and bare;
scarce a flower lifts up its head; the trees stand like
gaunt skeletons without apparent sign of life.  A
few hot genial days, a blowing of wind from the
south, and the whole scene is changed!  The primrose
nestles under every hedge, "the larch hangs
her tassels forth," the meadows are enamelled with
daisies, and the fruit-trees are decked with the
loveliest blossoms!  Again, dark moonless night
broods around; not even a star gleams through the
sable canopy of cloud; there is an incessant dripping
of rain.  Anon sunrise bursts over the landscape,
the clouds are golden, the raindrops gems, all
Nature laughs in brightness and beauty!
</p>

<p>
Such transformations occasionally occur in the life
of man, especially after seasons of trouble bravely
endured.  Such a transformation was experienced
by Walter after his return to India and civilised
life.  The interest which had been excited by his
disappearance was intensified by his return.
Afghanistan, on account of the war then commenced, being
in every one's mind, a gentleman who had actually
resided for seven years in a fort in that country
was naturally an object of curiosity and attention.
Walter found that every Englishman whom he met
was his friend.  Invitations followed invitations.
Go where he might he found a home; he was
welcomed into every circle.  This was principally,
but by no means entirely owing to young Gurney's
romantic adventures.  It was known that, though
himself poor, he came of what the world calls a
good family, and his popularity was also greatly due
to the uncommon attractions with which Walter had
been endowed by Nature.  The ladies declared him
to be the very beau-ideal of the hero of a romance.
</p>

<p>
There was some talk of a subscription being
raised to place the young man at college, either in
England or India, that he might complete his education,
partially neglected in early life, and for seven
years entirely suspended.  But Sir Cæsar Dashley,
a civilian of high position in the service, and a
distant relative of Dermot Denis, insisted on taking
the whole burden of expense on himself.
</p>

<p>
"I will be responsible for all charges," said he.
"It is clear that Gurney's imprisonment was the
result of his devotion to my unfortunate and gallant
cousin.  I am glad to have the opportunity of
serving so fine a fellow.  Whilst I remain in India,
Gurney shall never want a home."
</p>

<p>
After much prayerful consideration, Walter
decided on pursuing his studies in India; not
because it cost him nothing to give up his
long-cherished hope of visiting England, but because he
would not unnecessarily tax the generosity of a
friend, and also that he could best, by remaining
in Hindustan, master other Oriental tongues besides
those of Urdu and Pushtoo.  Walter entered a college
in one of the capital cities of India, and at once set
to work with vigour.  His mind was as a soil which
produces a hundredfold after lying fallow for several
years.  Study, a weariness to many, was to Walter
Gurney a source of pleasure.  He enjoyed it for
its own sake, and not merely as a means to an end.
The consciousness of success in every effort which
he made, was exhilarating to the young man's spirit.
Walter was like one who arrives so late in a
hunting-field that he fears that he will never overtake the
riders whom he sees at a distance before him, but
who finds that his first-rate steed not only overtakes,
but soon leads on in advance of them all.
</p>

<p>
"We never before had a student here who combined
such ardour and perseverance in study with
such brilliant natural ability," observed a college
professor to Walter's patron; "were he at Oxford or
Cambridge we should some day hear of Gurney's
coming out First Wrangler."
</p>

<p>
"And yet his fancy has been to qualify himself
for the obscure work of a missionary; and in Afghanistan,
too, of all places in the world!" exclaimed
Sir Cæsar.  "The idea is utterly absurd."
</p>

<p>
"Preposterous!" echoed the professor, "Gurney
has too much common sense to throw such talents
away."
</p>

<p>
The patron's generosity was not long required.
When an account of Walter's adventures, concluding
with the baptism in the Eagle's Nest, drawn up
by Mr. Coldstream, appeared in the <i>Times</i>, it excited
general interest.  The letter was copied into
almost every other paper.  Of course it reached
the breakfast-table of his uncle, Augustus Gurney.
The successful banker, who had now retired from
business on a handsome fortune, was proud of the
now famous nephew, whom in obscurity he had
despised.  Walter had not been two months in
college before a black-edged letter arrived written
in the same stiff hand as that whose contents, seven
years before, had pleased him so little.  This letter
was comparatively kind, and contained, moreover, a
cheque for three hundred pounds.  Augustus was
perhaps softened by trials which had come upon him
during the years which had passed.  He told his
nephew of the successive deaths of two of his three
sons by consumption.  He let Walter know that if
he chose to come to England he would have a
welcome either in Eaton Square or at Claverdon
Hall.  Walter was pleased at the invitation, though
he did not accept it, and wrote back a grateful letter
of thanks.
</p>

<p>
The young man cashed his cheque, which
appeared to him a mine of wealth.  His first care&mdash;to
him a delight&mdash;was to purchase numerous presents
for Sultána, her husband, and many other friends
in the Eagle's Nest.  The difficulty was how to
send them, for the city where Walter now resided
was many hundreds of miles from the frontier, and it
was by no means easy to make arrangements for
the safe transmission of valuable goods through a
country like Afghanistan, where utter lawlessness
prevailed.  Walter spared neither trouble nor
expense, but still felt uncertainty as to whether
either his gifts or his letters would reach the
Eagle's Nest.
</p>

<p>
Walter's next care was to repay his pecuniary
debt to Sir Cæsar&mdash;no small relief to the young
man's mind.  He procured a smaller cheque, which
he enclosed in an envelope, with a note to his
benefactor of thankful acknowledgment of kindness
unsought.  Sir Cæsar was sincerely glad that young
Gurney had an uncle with a good long purse; put
the cheque into his pocket, and the note into the
waste-paper basket.
</p>

<p>
Walter was now, indeed, basking in the sun of
prosperity, and his present good fortune was all the
more dazzling from contrast with its dark antecedents.
The first years of Walter's life had been
spent in utter obscurity; and straitened means had
at last seemed likely to end in utter destitution.
Then had come a struggle which had involved loss
of liberty, and perpetual hazard of life.  This
struggle, more or less severe, had lasted through
nearly seven long years.  Walter had never felt
sure that some fierce fit of anger,&mdash;nay, some mere
caprice of Assad Khan&mdash;might not bring on himself
a bastinado, or even loss of eyes or head.  Young
Gurney had pursued evangelising work under difficulties
which most men would have deemed insuperable.
No trophy had been won from Islam without
a perilous conflict.  In addition to this harassing
state of insecurity, it had been no small trial to
Walter to be debarred from all intercourse with men
of cultivated minds,&mdash;to live amongst the ignorant
and savage, deprived of access to literature.  Social
intercourse was now a choice feast, and Walter
partook of it with the relish of one who has been
intellectually starved.
</p>

<p>
Young Gurney was not so utterly absorbed in
his studies as to have no time for recreation, and
he enjoyed intensely such pleasures as had on them
no stigma of vice.  Very delightful was it to go
out in the cold weather, camping for a-while with
Sir Cæsar, enjoying constant change of scene, and
riding a spirited horse by the side of the
Commissioner's daughter.  Still more delightful, when
camping season was over, to stand by the piano in
the evening, and listen to, and join in, such classical
music as enchanted his soul.  The fair Flora never
cared to sing solos when Walter's rich melodious
voice was available for a duet.  He watched her
white jewelled fingers as they touched the instrument
with faultless execution and exquisite taste,
and almost felt, in the enthusiasm of his admiration,
that he could look and listen for ever.
</p>

<p>
As Flora occupied an increasingly large place in
Walter's thoughts, she must find some space in our
pages.  She was the eldest daughter of Sir Cæsar,
and in the absence of her mother, whom ill health
and the charge of younger children detained in
England, Flora reigned supreme in the handsome
establishment of the Commissioner Sahib.  She was
possessed of considerable personal beauty, and the
Bird of Paradise was the sobriquet by which she was
often spoken of in the circle of her admirers.  There
could scarcely have been a greater contrast than
that between the training of the Bird of Paradise
and that of the little Afghan Eaglet in her wild
mountain nest.  Imagination could hardly have
pictured Flora Dashley scrambling about rocks
barefoot, cooking her own dinner, or eating it with her
fingers!  Sir Cæsar, of rather pompous manner
and ostentatious character, took pleasure in relating
what fabulous sums he had spent on his daughter's
education.  She had had first-rate masters in
music, drawing, and dancing, and to perfect her
accomplishments had passed several years on the
Continent.  The result was such as perfectly to
satisfy her father.  In charms, personal and acquired,
few could equal his Flora.
</p>

<p>
It was prognosticated as soon as the young lady
joined Sir Cæsar in India, that before many months
had passed she would certainly change her name.
But years had passed, and she was Flora Dashley
still.  The Bird of Paradise enjoyed her freedom.
She could hardly be more pleasantly situated than
in the house of her wealthy father, with no heavier
trials than the sleepiness of <i>punkah-walas</i>* or the
spoiling of a dress by the moths.  Besides unnumbered
native servants to obey her commands, Flora
had always some of her young countrymen eager to
anticipate every wish, to break in a horse, or copy
out music, or even undertake the heroic task of
trying to tune her piano.
</p>

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It was a rich enjoyment to Walter to converse
with so refined and highly educated a young lady;
it was to him a new, and most delightful phase of
existence.  Walter seldom cared to talk to others of
his life in the Afghan mountains, but Flora drew
him out with her questions, and it thrilled the
young man with pleasure to see the interest shown
by her in his strange adventures.  Walter was by
no means certain that his charming companion had
yet given her heart to the Lord; but was not her
ready listening to accounts of conversions amongst
the Afghans a sign that a missionary spirit was
stirring within her?  Gurney guessed not how utter
would have been Flora's indifference had the tales
been told by some grey-headed pastor.
</p>

<p>
Walter would fain have persuaded himself that
the pains taken by Flora with the church-choir
denoted pious inclinations; he cared not to think
that her exquisite singing of hymns and sacred songs
was due to her love of music, and not to her love
of God.  If her admirer could not hide from himself
that the lady delighted in worldly amusements,
Walter made every excuse for her education and
present surroundings.  Flora could enjoy reading a
volume of Miss Havergal's beautiful poetry which
he had placed in her hands; this Walter took as a
token for good.  He tried earnestly to draw the
fair English maiden upwards, as he had been the
means of drawing Sultána, and did not at first
recognise the truth that, blinded by his admiration
for Flora, he was making an excuse to his conscience
for remaining in a position which imperilled his own
spirituality.
</p>

<p>
But conscience, in Walter's breast, was too
faithful a watchman to be easily silenced.  If the
Christian had found the pillar of fire his cheering
light in the dark hours of tribulation, the pillar of
cloud was now shading him from the more dangerous
glare of prosperity's sun.  It was not only that it
kept his life pure in the midst of many temptations,
but it made him search his own heart.  Walter
became painfully aware that, while advancing in
everything else, he was not advancing in spiritual
life.  Secular study sometimes encroached on time
that would otherwise have been given to study of
Scripture; and the image of Flora's dark eyes
intruded often on his devotions.  Walter was not
contented with his own state, and that uneasiness
was in itself a good sign.
</p>

<p>
Was Walter's promise to Sultána forgotten amidst
the eager pursuit of knowledge and the fascinations
of civilised life?  No; morn and even the little
band of Christians in the Eagle's Nest were
remembered in earnest prayer.  But it is natural that
visible surroundings and the interests of daily life
should engage more constant attention than what
belongs to memory alone.  During the fascinating
two years which Walter passed at college, he
received no communication of any kind from his
friends in the fort.  Walter wrote repeatedly to
Ali Khan in a large printed hand, which he had
taught Sultána to read, but it need hardly be said
that there was no available post to the mountain
home.  Walter was in uncertainty as to whether
his letters or presents ever arrived, as no one in the
fort was able to write.  This difficulty of
communication, with doubt as to its success, was
very discouraging to Walter.  It seemed as if he
were as little able to exchange tidings with his
Afghan friends as if they existed only in dreamland.
</p>

<p>
And, as time wore on, increasingly did Walter's
engagement to return to his little flock in the
mountains press on his heart like a chain.  Every
one with whom the young man entered on the
subject, more or less condemned his plan as
impracticable and wild.  Yet Walter could not
let himself be persuaded that a resolution made
with earnest prayer should be put aside because
man thought it unwise.  The remembrance of the
blessing which had followed his efforts in the Eagle's
Nest could not be blotted out by college professors
speaking of wasting talents, which would give him
influence over thousands of educated minds, on a
few bloodthirsty Afghans.  Walter was not
convinced when Sir Cæsar spoke indignantly of a
promising, rising young man throwing himself utterly
away; but, though unconvinced, Walter felt that
inclination was constantly drawing him more and
more away from a course pointed out by honour
and duty, till he regarded almost with aversion the
idea of returning to Afghanistan.
</p>

<p>
"I must end this miserable indecision," thought
Walter, "and act as my conscience prompts."
</p>

<p>
Young Gurney wrote a letter to the committee of
a Missionary Society in England, describing his own
position.  He informed the committee that a bishop
in India had consented to ordain him, after a two
years' course of study, should he pass the required
examination.  The examination would be over before
a reply could be received from England, and should
the result be favourable, Walter offered himself to
the Society for a post in Afghanistan.  He described
the small nucleus of a Christian Church existing in
the Eagle's Nest; it might be a centre of missionary
effort amongst a people yet unreached by the
Gospel.  Walter mentioned no personal qualifications
but fluency in Pushtoo, and an earnest desire to win
souls.
</p>

<p>
Walter despatched his letter to England, and
then confessed to Miss Dashley what he had done.
Flora looked surprised, and a little annoyed, but
presently said with a smile, "The committee will not
accept you; you will have to submit to remain with
us, Walter."  It was the first time that the young
lady had called him by his Christian name; how
exquisitely sweet it was to hear that name from her
lips!
</p>

<p>
"Would you believe it, papa?" said Flora to her
father, who entered the room at that moment; "Mr. Gurney
is offering himself for a mission in Afghanistan."
</p>

<p>
"The thing is impracticable," said Sir Cæsar in
the tone of one who lays down the law.  "My
term of service being nearly completed, in two
months we shall start for England, and Walter had
better come with us.  You will have your uncle's
interest to give you a good start in life," he
continued, addressing himself to young Gurney; "I
advise your entering on a course at the bar.  I
should not wonder," he added more gaily, "if you
ended your career on the woolsack."
</p>

<p>
As in the interim between sending his letter, and
receiving its reply, Walter never entered again with
Flora on a distasteful subject, the lady almost forgot
the whole affair.  She was much engaged in
preparations for a fancy ball, which she could not
persuade the student to attend even by the lure of
seeing her in Afghan costume personate his favourite
Sultána.  But often&mdash;very often&mdash;even in the midst
of hard study, did Walter think, almost without
fear, of what the mail from England might bring.
His reading up for examination gave him a fair and
true excuse for seeing less of Miss Dashley; but
very hard was it to keep almost entirely away,
except on Sundays, especially as the dreaded time
of parting was every day drawing near and more
near.
</p>

<p>
With almost feverish impatience the secretary's
reply was opened when it arrived about a week after
Walter had passed his examination with brilliant
success.  The letter, though couched in rather
formal terms, was full of Christian courtesy.  The
committee, it said, had given due consideration to
Mr. Gurney's offer to devote himself to founding a
mission in the country of the Afghans.  His high
motives, his devotion and zeal, were highly
appreciated.  But after much thought the committee felt
unable to send any agent into so dangerous a field,
beyond the protection of the British flag.  If
Mr. Gurney would volunteer for work in India, his offer
would be gladly entertained.
</p>

<p>
Walter gave a sigh&mdash;was it of disappointment, or
of relief?  He could scarcely have defined his own
feelings.  Almost intuitively he bent his steps
towards the dwelling in which Flora resided, but
paused at the entrance to listen to the delicious
tones of her voice.  He found the young lady at the
piano.  Flora had just finished her Italian song,
and received her visitor with a smile.
</p>

<p>
"I thought that you were forgetting us," she
said; "I have been wanting you for a practice."
</p>

<p>
Silently Walter Gurney placed the letter in
Flora's hand, and watched her face to see what
emotions it might call forth.
</p>

<p>
"The committee show some sense," the lady
remarked, returning the letter.  "I hope that
now you will give up for ever your mad idea of
re-visiting the Eagle's Nest."
</p>

<p>
"But my promise?" murmured Walter Gurney.
</p>

<p>
"You are not bound by so foolish a promise.
Suppose that I promised to spend a week in the
house of a friend, and on my arrival found all the
building in flames!  Does honour compel me to
stay and be burnt?"
</p>

<p>
"The case is not quite to the point," said Walter.
"I have passed seven years in the Eagle's Nest, and
my danger would not be greater, but much less
than it was at the first.  When I entered it, I had
not amongst the Afghans a single friend, save one
poor child; now I have seven friends, Christian
friends, to help&mdash;or desert!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I cannot argue on such matters," said
Flora, turning over the leaves of her music-book to
find some particular duet.  "But really,
Walter&mdash;Mr. Gurney&mdash;you should turn your mind from such
projects, as regards Afghanistan or any other place.
The profession of a missionary is not quite that
of&mdash;of&mdash;&mdash;-"  She hesitated, not wishing to give
offence.  "I mean, that with prospects like yours,
you might do a great deal better."
</p>

<p>
These few words gave Walter acute pain; they
betrayed such utter want of sympathy in what
regarded the spreading of the Gospel, in the woman
whose favour was to him as the very sunshine of life.
</p>

<p>
Flora ran her fingers lightly over the keys.  "It
is for the bass to begin," said she.
</p>

<p>
Walter mechanically sang through the duet;
his thoughts were far, far away.  When the
practising was over, he somewhat hastily took his
departure.
</p>

<p>
Long did young Gurney ponder over the conversation
at night, in the solitude of his chamber, with
his Bible open before him.  Had he not, again and
again, given himself, with all his powers, all his
talents, to the service of a crucified Lord, and now
was he not suffering the world gradually to enclose
him in a snare, none the less strong because its
meshes were formed of the softest silk?  Whence
came his increasing repugnance to fulfil his promise
to Sultána?  Was it not the impossibility of taking
an English bride to the Afghan mountains?
Walter dared scarcely think of Miss Dashley in
connection with his own future; union with Sir
Cæsar's daughter seemed almost as utterly beyond
his hopes as if she had been a star; yet&mdash;yet&mdash;things
more impossible had happened before.  Oh,
how delicious were day-dreams! but were they
safe?&mdash;were they right?
</p>

<p>
Walter knelt down and prayed for guidance, that
Divine guidance which is never honestly sought in
vain.  He remained long on his knees.  The young
man arose with a pale cheek and a heavy heart.
He opened his desk, and wrote a letter to his
bishop, offering himself as a candidate for orders in
the ordination shortly to take place, previous to
entering on honorary missionary work.  Walter
enveloped the letter, and shut it up in his desk.
He then retired to his couch, but not to sleep; no
slumber visited his eyes on that night.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX.
<br><br>
DECISION.
</h3>

<p>
The following dawn ushered in Sunday.  Walter
was accustomed on that day to breakfast with
Sir Cæsar, and then accompany him and his
daughter to church, a privilege which made him an
object of envy to some young officers and civilians.
Young Gurney did not on this day break the
understood engagement.  Those Sabbath mornings
sometimes gave him an opportunity of speaking a
few words on religious subjects to Flora, or reading
sacred poetry, of which they both were fond.  How
soon these too happy mornings would become things
of the past!
</p>

<p>
At the accustomed hour Walter mounted the
broad flight of steps which led to the wide verandah,
and pushing aside the green <i>chik</i>,* entered the
drawing-room, in which were seated Sir Cæsar and
his daughter.  What a contrast that drawing-room
presented to Walter's quarters in the Eagle's Nest!
The Indian mat which covered the floor was itself
partly hidden under rich Cashmere rugs, tiger's
skins, and the thick fur of the bear.  The whiteness
of the walls was relieved by painted arabesque
patterns, with here and there a chromograph or
well-selected print in a gilded frame.  The tables
were adorned with fine china, and delicate specimens
of Agra's inlaid marble work.  A profusion of
flowers from a dozen vases filled the air with
delicious perfume.  In a most richly-carved ebony
cabinet appeared a collection of elegantly-bound
books; albums lay on one of the tables.  It was
the home of luxury; and everything on which the
eye rested, from the grand piano to the small bird
of exquisite plumage in its flower-wreathed cage,
told of the presiding taste of a refined and
cultivated woman.  It was a fit perch for a Bird of
Paradise.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* A kind of blind, admitting the free circulation of air.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Sir Cæsar, on the easiest of easy chairs, was
enjoying the coolness imparted by the measured,
monotonous swing of the <i>punkah</i>;* for, though it
was but the end of March, the weather was already
oppressively hot.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* An enormous kind of fan.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Well, Walter," said Sir Cæsar, without rising
for any more formal greeting, "we're to be off a
good deal sooner than I had expected.  I've had a
telegram to say that the Warings, who were going
by next week's steamer, are detained by one of the
children taking the measles, so that their cabins
are vacant.  It's not a chance to be lost, though it
rather hurries our movements; but it's worth a push
to get out of this heat.  So Flora and I will be off
in a week.  Don't look so startled, my good friend.
I mean you to come with us, and we'll take Italy
in our way."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes; it will delight you to see the
art-treasures of Venice, Rome, and Florence," cried
Flora.  "Certainly, you must come with us."
</p>

<p>
The conversation was interrupted by the entrance
of Captain Mills, an officer invited to breakfast.
</p>

<p>
A native servant in livery, bright with scarlet
and gold, but with shoeless feet, announced that
the meal was on the table; and Flora led the way
into the room, in which was spread a luxurious
repast served by half-a-dozen attendants.
</p>

<p>
Walter was unusually silent.  The tidings of the
sudden departure had struck like a knell in his
heart.  Sir Cæsar talked enough for both; he was
full of his projected Italian tour.
</p>

<p>
Soon after the conclusion of the lengthened
breakfast, the bells began to chime for Divine
service, and in due course of time the party
proceeded to the stately-looking church.  Walter took
his accustomed place behind Flora in the choir.
Was it for the last time? he thought, with a pang;
or might he not avail himself of Sir Cæsar's offer,
as he had now an uncle's home to visit in England?
The young man was dazzled by the brightness of
the prospect opening before him, yet felt&mdash;had
there been no other reason against his going&mdash;that
it was undesirable to travel as a pensioner on Sir Cæsar's bounty.
</p>

<p>
It was exceedingly difficult for Walter to keep
his attention to the prayers; he tried to do so, but
scarcely succeeded.  But it was very different when
the organ pealed forth the first hymn.  This hymn
was a great favourite with Flora, who poured forth
in it her splendid voice without giving a thought to
the meaning of the words.  But the words were to
Walter the very soul of the hymn, merely clothed
with a musical body.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Nearer, my God, to Thee,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearer to Thee,<br>
  E'en though it be a cross<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That raiseth me."<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Walter could not sing that verse at that moment;
he felt that it would be a mockery to offer that
prayer in which his rebellious heart did not join;
it would be an act of hypocrisy, for he saw plainly
the cross before him, and he shrank from taking it
up.  To him, at that crisis in his life, the mountain
fort in Afghanistan appeared much as the burning
fiery furnace must have appeared to the three
young Jews.  Flora missed the familiar voice
behind her, which had hitherto ever blended so
harmoniously with her own.
</p>

<p>
After leaving the church, Walter declined Sir
Cæsar's invitation to come home with him to tiffin.
He had sometimes shared that meal, but had never
joined in the Sunday drive, or the Sunday
dinner-party.  Walter felt that he must be alone; he
could never exercise a calm judgment on such a
matter as the important decision before him, under
the fascination of Flora's presence.
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter with Gurney to-day?" said
Sir Cæsar, when Walter had quitted the party.
"He has been mum as a fish, did not sing, and
looks thoroughly upset."
</p>

<p>
"He has studied too hard," observed Flora; but
her smile betokened that some other cause for the
young man's trouble had occurred to her mind.
</p>

<p>
"He feels this weather as I do," cried Sir
Cæsar, passing his handkerchief over his heated brow.
</p>

<p>
"By-the-by," said Captain Mills, "did you see
the paragraph in the <i>Weekly Times</i> which came by
this mail?"
</p>

<p>
"I have not opened the paper yet," said Sir Cæsar.
</p>

<p>
"There's a paragraph about a certain Gilbert
Gurney, only surviving son of Augustus Gurney,
Esq. of Eaton Square and Claverdon Hall being
killed by a fall in the hunting-field."
</p>

<p>
"Ha! that must be the son of Walter's uncle!"
exclaimed Sir Cæsar; "then our friend Walter will
be, I suppose, next heir to a handsome estate and
at least ten thousand a-year."
</p>

<p>
"Lucky fellow!" ejaculated the captain; "lucky
in everything I take it.  But I don't suppose that
the property is entailed, and Mr. Gurney of Claverdon
Hall may not sympathise with his nephew's missionary
peculiarities."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we'll hear no more of that nonsense now,"
said Sir Cæsar; "the heir to ten thousand per
annum will see matters in quite a new light."
</p>

<p>
There the conversation on the subject ended.
Flora had not joined in it, but busied herself with
newly arranging some flowers in a vase.  But it
was noticed by those who accompanied her in her
afternoon ride that the young lady was in unusually
high spirits at the prospect of her speedy departure for England.
</p>

<p>
Walter's spirits were as depressed as hers were
elevated.  He passed a second sleepless night, and
on the Monday morning was absent from the morning
lecture at the college.
</p>

<p>
As he sat at his solitary breakfast, a letter was
brought in which bore English post-marks.  It had
arrived by the same mail as that from the secretary
of the mission, but a mistake in the address had for
two days delayed its transmission.  The student
expected no letter from England, as his uncle, his
only correspondent there, had written to him but
twice in the course of nine years.  But Walter
recognised the handwriting of Augustus Gurney.
His epistle, as usual, was brief:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Dear Walter,&mdash;You have probably seen in the
papers that I have had the misfortune to lose my
last remaining son, killed by a fall from his horse.
You are now my nearest relative, and in declining
years, with broken health, I should like to have one
beside me.  If you accept the position of a son, I
propose receiving you as my heir.  Come to England
at once; I enclose a cheque for travelling expenses."
</p>

<p>
Walter felt dizzy,&mdash;almost as if he had received
a stroke of the sun.  Will he sink very low in the
reader's estimation when it is owned that the latter
gave him a wild thrill of delight?  It was not that
he coveted a fortune,&mdash;it was not merely the prospect
of wealth that made his pulse beat so high.  As a
penniless adventurer he could hardly have aspired
to the hand of Flora Dashley; but the heir of the
wealthy Augustus Gurney might, without any
presumption, ask her to be his bride.  Walter sprang
from his seat, and with rapid steps paced up and
down the apartment.  Satan tempted him&mdash;as he
is so ready to tempt God's people&mdash;with arguments
drawn from religion itself.  Was not this letter,
coming at so critical a time, an indication of the
leading of Providence?  What a talent to be used
for God would be wealth devoted to the noblest
objects!  What visions of schools opened and
alms-houses built, a happy peasantry, a delightful home,
rose before the mental vision of Walter!  He was
almost persuaded for a few moments that his own
will was the will of God.  His was nearly being a
case of spiritual sun-stroke indeed.
</p>

<p>
Walter's intoxicating day-dream was interrupted
by the entrance of Will Green, a gay young college
companion.
</p>

<p>
"Walter, you played truant from the lecture this
morning.  I'm glad that you kept me in countenance
for once.  No" (as Walter motioned for him
to take a chair), "I've really no time to sit down.
I've brought you a present, a dirty old picture from
the bazaar, put up for two annas, and hardly worth
them.  But I saw your good father's name and
Santgunge written in the corner, so I thought that
it might be some family relic of yours that I had
lighted on by chance.  There it is," he added,
throwing down his purchase on the table; "I can't
stop now, I have an appointment," and the student
went off as suddenly as he had entered.
</p>

<p>
A family relic, yes!  In that stained, fly-spotted,
insect-eaten piece of paper, Walter recognised the
picture which had hung in his earliest home; it was
the print of the Israelites crossing the desert, the
story of which, Walter as a child, had first heard
from the lips of his mother.  As he gazed on it
the young man seemed to hear again the voice of
his venerated father uttering these words, which had
been Walter's comfort in one of the most critical
points of his life&mdash;"God may lead us into a desert,
my boy, but it is a blessed way if His presence go
with us."
</p>

<p>
A straw may turn a balance; a single sentence
change the course of a life.  Walter was again on
his knees, in a wrestling agony of prayer.  He
arose comparatively calm, but pale as a corpse.
Walter sat down, opened his desk, and took out
the letter which he had written to the bishop, but
which he had not yet had resolution to send.  He
then, with unsteady hand, wrote another.  It was
a grateful one to Sir Cæsar, thanking him for
kindness which could never be either repaid or
forgotten, but bidding him a long farewell.  Walter
could give no reason for not seeking a personal
interview; he thought that a father might guess the
cause.  Young Gurney could not trust himself to
say good-by to Flora.  He but added a postscript,
with a hand that trembled with agitation, in which
he requested Sir Cæsar to remember him gratefully
to his daughter.
</p>

<p>
It was almost as painful a task to write to his
uncle; Walter was as one undergoing an operation,
who would, while writhing under the knife, have all
over as quickly as might be.  The terrible work
was over&mdash;the letters completed, enveloped, and
sealed.  Walter summoned the servant who waited
in the verandah, gave him the three epistles, bade
him take two to their respective destinations, and
the third to the post.  When he had done this,
the unhappy young man seemed to have reached
the utmost point of endurance.  As the servant
departed, Walter sank back on his chair, and
covered his face with his hands.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, pillar of cloud!&mdash;dark, terrible pillar!"
he groaned; "thou art leading me into a waste
and howling wilderness, indeed!"
</p>

<p>
In another hour Walter was being whirled along
in a train, he cared not whither; he had taken his
ticket almost at random for a place of which he
scarcely knew the name, and whose recommendation
was that it was so retired that he was not likely to
meet there with any one who knew him.  There,
in a dreary <i>dák-bungalow</i>* young Gurney lay for
some days in a fever; before he had thoroughly
recovered, Sir Cæsar and his daughter had started
for England.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* A kind of inn, provided by Government for the
convenience of travellers.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Walter Gurney had narrowly escaped from one
of the chief perils of his life&mdash;that of union with a
vain and worldly woman, who would sooner have
drawn him down to her own level than have risen
up to his.  He had all but crossed over the stile
into the Bypath Meadow described by Bunyan,
which leads to the territory of Giant Despair; that
he had not done so was the result of faith's upward
glance at the pillar of cloud and fire.

<h3>
CHAPTER XX.
<br><br>
A POST OF PERIL.
</h3>

<p>
It is now time to return to the little band of
Afghan converts left in the Eagle's Nest.
</p>

<p>
Whilst Walter had been basking in the
dangerous glare of prosperity, a sharp storm of trial
had been sweeping over his native friends.  He
had not been fully aware how all-important had
been the support of an Englishman's influence,
talent, and courage, to the newly-baptised chief, Ali
Khan.  It was now as if the principal pillar
supporting an edifice had been taken away, or a
vessel in a gale had been reft both of its main-mast
and rudder.  Yet as a building may still stand,
though its strongest prop be removed, and a vessel
float on the waves though main-mast and rudder be
lost, so the chief in the Eagle's Nest for years held
his dangerous post.  This was chiefly owing to the
following three causes.
</p>

<p>
Ali Khan was a brave and&mdash;until his baptism&mdash;a
popular leader.  Though he now discouraged
war and forbade plunder, no one could doubt the
courage of a man who had slain a bear single-handed,
and who had brought home more trophies of the chase
than did any other hunter in the clan.  Once finding
three of his men, against his express orders,
looting and beating a travelling merchant, Ali Khan
had knocked down the chief offender, expelled him
from the tribe, and made the two others undergo
the bastinado.  This vigorous execution of justice
had for a time a very salutary effect on the minds
of his turbulent followers.  The Afghans saw that
they had to deal with no child.
</p>

<p>
And Ali Khan, as the husband of Sultána,
commanded a certain amount of respect.  The young
eaglet had from childhood been the darling of the
clan, and now they were proud of her, Christian as
she was, as being, in their eyes, the brightest,
bravest, most beautiful woman in all their land.
Sultána was no <i>pardah</i> prisoner in her zenana; her
light step, the glance of her eye, the tones of her
voice were familiar to all in the fort.  There were
many who had received from her personal kindness
not readily to be forgotten.  In everything relating
to the management of his troublesome people,
Sultána was to her husband more than a right hand.
</p>

<p>
There was a third advantage possessed by the
chief.  From the manner in which Walter Gurney
had been received at the English camp, it was
concluded by the Afghans that he must have great
influence with the powerful invaders.  The British
troops were sweeping through Afghanistan, and
tidings of their wonderful marches and signal
victories reached the Eagle's Nest.  Even when
our warriors vacated the land, they left their
prestige behind.  The Afghans of the fort had an
impression that Walter would return, and should
he find his friend Ali Khan defeated or deposed,
would draw on them English vengeance.  The iron
hand of power which had twice reached Kabul itself,
would easily crush a small tribe so near the British
dominions.  Thus, for a considerable time, his own
character, his wife's influence, and the fear of
Walter's anger made discontented Moslems submit
to the control of a Christian chief.
</p>

<p>
But there were no more conversions.  It had
been Walter Gurney's habit, during the latter part
of his residence in the Eagle's Nest, to give daily
expositions of Scripture, followed by singing and
prayer; and his parables had been so attractive, his
music so fine, his descriptions so vivid, that many
unconverted Afghans had gathered around to hear
him.  Often the nod of assent, or the appreciative
"wah! wah!" had expressed approval&mdash;if not of the
doctrine, yet of the illustration employed by the
gifted preacher.
</p>

<p>
It was very different when Ali Khan, keeping his
place on the page with his swarthy finger, read
slowly, and with many mistakes, from the manuscript
left for his use by Walter.  His audience comprised
none but the Christians, sometimes only his wife,
for her venerable grandmother was slowly sinking
into the grave.  The seed sown by Walter had in
most cases fallen on the beaten highway; as soon
as he had quitted the fort, the evil one carried it
away.
</p>

<p>
Nor were there wanting illustrations of the seed
falling on the stony ground, and springing up only
to die.  Mirza, one of the baptised seven, soon grew
weary of isolation from his Moslem companions, and
of bearing their taunts and ill-treatment.  He very
easily persuaded himself that though Christianity
might be good for Feringhees, it would never suit
the Afghan.  Mohammed Sahib had been a bold and
successful chief, who had permitted his followers to
loot, had encouraged them to kill, and had promised
on easy terms to his followers paradise and its
houris.  The oriental mind is not logical; Walter's
proofs of the truth of Christianity, if ever understood
by Mirza, were forgotten almost as soon as heard.
First the Afghan absented himself from prayers,
then received reproof with sullen anger; finally he
openly joined the party in the fort who scarcely
attempted to conceal their dislike of their Christian
chief, and their resolution to resist innovations.
Mirza's wife, as a matter of course, followed the lead
of her husband, and never, except from necessity,
came near Sultána.
</p>

<p>
Then came death, still further to lessen the little
band of Christians.  Sultána's aged relative passed
from earth.  Her faith had been as that of a little
child, and with the simple trust of a little child she
obeyed the call of her Heavenly Father.  Sultána,
as she gazed on the placid face of the dead, felt that
the venerable woman had indeed been taken from
the evil to come.  She was sheltered in the grave&mdash;or
rather in the land of the blessed&mdash;from the
trials and perils which every day were coming on
thicker and faster.
</p>

<p>
The mind of Ali Khan was sorely troubled by
the spreading spirit of disaffection; his patience
sometimes gave way under the daily provocations
to which he was now exposed.  His faith might
have failed altogether, had it not been sustained by
the firmer piety of his young wife.
</p>

<p>
"I am weary of my life!" exclaimed the chief
one day, as he entered the upper apartment or
zenana, where Sultána was plying her wheel.
</p>

<p>
"Mirza is a false traitor to me as well as to his
faith; he is trying to undermine my power in my
own fort.  Half of the men of my tribe would
not care were I to share the fate of the
yellow-haired stranger.  There were curses muttered
to-day which I did not choose to seem to hear, as a
Christian must not for a personal affront knock down
a fellow with the butt end of a gun, or shoot him
through the head.  The fellows know that, and they
take their advantage.  Our Feringhee friend should
never have come, or never have left us!"
</p>

<p>
"He will come again," said Sultána; "he
promised to return to his Afghan children, and he
never will break his word."
</p>

<p>
"He hath sent us no token, and years have gone
by," said the chief, gloomily, seating himself on the
skin of a cheetah, spread on the bare floor.  It was
too true that neither Walter's letters nor gifts had
reached their destination; the latter had been
appropriated by their bearers, or the unscrupulous
Afghans of the fort; the former, which Sultána
would have prized more highly, had been destroyed
or flung away.
</p>

<p>
"My men," continued the chief, "accustomed to
a wild life of plunder, cannot or will not take to
the means of earning their livelihood which the
Feringhee friend proposed.  They say that they
are not Persians to weave carpets, nor Kashmiris to
embroider shawls.  They are accustomed not to
make but to take; not to exchange goods but
to seize them."
</p>

<p>
"My lord has many troubles," said Sultána; "but
there is One who can and will bear him through all.
We will not yield, nor fear, nor complain."
</p>

<p>
"I feel the difficulty myself," said the chief,
pursuing the train of his own thoughts.  "In old
times when we needed aught, we belted on scimitars
and loaded our guns, and made a sudden foray.
We came back fewer perhaps in numbers, but anyhow
laden with spoil.  Now&mdash;how am I to provide
for your needs and my own?  I have not a silver
piece left."
</p>

<p>
"My lord will never shrink from poverty endured
for Christ's sake," said Sultána.
</p>

<p>
"I do not shrink," said the chief; "I know that
it is better to starve as a Christian than feast as a
Moslem."
</p>

<p>
"My lord will not starve," said Sultána; "have
we not heard that God feeds the ravens?"  She
had stopped her wheel in order to converse, and
now drew the anklets over her slender bare feet,
took the jewels from her ears, and the ornaments
from her beautiful hair.  Silently she placed them
beside her husband.
</p>

<p>
"How could I rob you of your jewels!" he
exclaimed, knowing how precious to the women of
the East are such personal adornments.
</p>

<p>
"I need them not," said the daughter of a robber
chief&mdash;how changed from what she had been in her
childhood!  "Let me not lay up treasures on earth;
mine is the pearl of great price."
</p>

<p>
And a gift better than gems was to reward the
young Afghan wife.  In the course of that month
a little bud of beauty bloomed beside the parent
rose.  Sultána clasped in her arms a lovely boy,
and in grateful adoration she and her husband
devoted him at once to the Lord.
</p>

<p>
Few earthly joys come without some drawbacks.
It caused great dissatisfaction in the fort that the
birth of the chief's first-born son was not celebrated
by the gluttonous revels and superstitious orgies
which had never before been omitted in the Eagle's
Nest on such a joyful occasion.  Sheep indeed had
been killed, and a banquet provided; but vice and
profanity had been excluded, and to the special
indignation of the old women, not a single charm
against the evil eye had been tied around the neck
of the babe!
</p>

<p>
Ali Khan and Sultána had long been making a
brave struggle to swim against the tide of
dissatisfaction, but now it appeared likely to sweep
them away in its current.  Mustapha was&mdash;and had
been for months&mdash;plotting against his chief.  The
traitor tried, and succeeded but too well, in stirring
up the smouldering embers of discontent into a flame.
He contrived to have another key made for the large
outer gate, so that it could be opened without the
knowledge of Ali Khan, who, like his predecessor,
always kept the key at night.  Then Mustapha
arranged a meeting of Afghans in a retired spot
outside the fort, and to this meeting all the men except
Mir Ghazan and Ali Khan himself were invited.
</p>

<p>
The gathering took place by moonlight,&mdash;by
knots of twos and threes the mountaineers sought
the appointed place.  When Mustapha judged that
the number was complete, springing on a piece of
rock which raised him a little above his audience,
with passionate gestures he addressed the listening
throng of the fierce, long-haired Afghans.
</p>

<p>
"How long, O Pathans! will you submit to the
rule of a vile renegade, who has left his faith to
become the disciple of a Feringhee Kafir, who has
deceived, and now deserted him!  Are you, who
soared like mountain eagles, ye who as eagles
swooped down on your prey, to become as timorous
doves?  Is the bear who went crashing through the
woods in his freedom, defying and destroying
whoever opposed him, to be led by a silken thread?
Ye are not men, ye are women, if ye longer own
Ali Khan as your chief, seeing that he has disgraced
his name, deserted his faith, and cast dirt on the
graves of our fathers!"
</p>

<p>
"Down with him! down with him! death to the
infidel!" cried some of the fiercer of the Afghans,
unsheathing their knives.
</p>

<p>
The disaffection was not universal; Ali Khan
had still his admirers and Sultána her friends even
in that excited throng; but, as is usually the case,
the louder voices and the more fiery spirits carried
the day.
</p>

<p>
"Mustapha is our chief!  Down with Ali Khan&mdash;hurl
him from the rock!" shouted the renegade
Mirza; and others took up the cry, "Mustapha!
Mustapha! the true believer!  Mustapha is the
chief of our clan!"
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap21"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI.
<br><br>
THE ATTACK.
</h3>

<p>
"Awake, awake, Ali Khan! chief! if you
would not be slain where you lie!" was
the loud summons which startled the
Afghan from his repose.
</p>

<p>
"It is the voice of Mir Ghazan!" exclaimed
Ali, springing from his couch, and seizing his
scimitar.
</p>

<p>
"If the chief linger, Mustapha and his rebels
will be upon him!  No time for delay!" cried Mir
Ghazan, as Ali Khan drew back the heavy curtain
which served in place of a door.
</p>

<p>
"What mean ye?" asked the Afghan chief.
"Mustapha left the fort at noon and cannot return
at night, for the key of the gate is with me."
</p>

<p>
"I know not how that may be," said Mir Ghazan,
with impatience; "I found the gate open not an
hour ago, for there had been a stirring in the
courtyard, and I knew that some mischief was brewing.
I went forth, following two figures that moved
before me; they stopped just below the Vulture's
Crag.  I was present, unseen, at a meeting where,
had they caught a glimpse of me, I had been
silenced with a dagger.  Mustapha is rousing the
tribe against us Christians.  I outstripped the
rebels to give you warning, but even at this
moment the bloodthirsty throng must be close at
the gate.  Hark! hear you not their wild yells!"
</p>

<p>
Sultána, pale, but perfectly calm, with Rahim,
her ten-days' old babe in her arms, now stood by
the side of her husband.  "We have no means of
escape," she said; "if we go to the gate we but
meet them.  Let us hasten to the Feringhee's
room" (it still commonly went by that name); "it
has a strong door and a lock.  We can at least
hold out there for some hours&mdash;till the Lord, in His
mercy, send us succour."
</p>

<p>
There was no time for more words.  Mir
Ghazan's wife, roused by the noise, was at the foot
of the dark stair which led up to the chief's
apartments.  The small band of Christians with hurried
steps made their way into the court-yard, open to
the silver moonlight, and then sped up the ladder
staircase, Ali Khan himself being the last to mount
it.  Scarcely had he entered the Feringhee's room
when the court-yard was full of Pathans, some
shouting the Moslems' hulma* some, "Down with the
renegade <i>Karanis</i>!  Mustapha!  Mustapha! he is
our chief!"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* "There is but one God, and Mohammed is his prophet."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The door was shut, the key turned in the lock.
Thus a breathing space of time was secured to the
fugitives, standing in semi-darkness within their
narrow place of retreat.
</p>

<p>
"Let us pray," said Sultána, and every knee was
bent in silent prayer.
</p>

<p>
There was a rush up the ladder, an angry knocking
and thumping at the door; but the timber of
which it was made was strong, and resisted the
efforts of Ali Khan's assailants.
</p>

<p>
"Let alone!" cried a voice from without, loud
enough to be heard above the clamour.  "We have
good allies within yon room.  Unless the eagles
bring the Kafirs food, and the hot winds water,
hunger and thirst will soon force them to open the
door!"
</p>

<p>
The words had their effect.  The assault was for
the time reduced to a blockade.  No one was to be
suffered to come out of the prison which the
Christians had made their fortress.  Pent up in
their narrow quarters, exposed to hunger, thirst, and
heat (for the month was May), the Kafirs should be
driven at last to surrender and apostatise&mdash;or
perish.  In the meantime their enemies should feast;
there should be a banquet to celebrate the elevation
of Mustapha to the leadership of the tribe, and his
fallen rival should hear the festal mirth.
</p>

<p>
Wild noisy revelry took place in the court-yard,
and lasted till long after dawn.  Notwithstanding
the affected fervour of their religious zeal, some of
the Afghans unscrupulously broke the law of their
Prophet by copious libations of the strictly
forbidden drink.  Bang, a spirituous liquor, was freely
circulated round, and its effects were shown in
louder shouting, coarser jests, and more savage
threats.  It was as if demons were holding their
revels below.
</p>

<p>
As day advanced the noises gradually ceased;
no banquet can last for ever; most of the revellers
were stretched in drunken slumber.  But Mustapha
had effectually provided against the escape of his
victims by placing an armed guard of the more
sober of his men to watch in turns in front of the
ladder.  The opening of the door above would be a
signal for instant attack, or the fugitives would be
shot down, one by one, as they emerged from their
prison.
</p>

<p>
It was a time when the faith of the Christians
in that upper room was tried in a very hot furnace.
The courage of Fatima, Mir Ghazan's wife, was not
equal to the trial.  The poor woman beat her
breast, and tore her hair, and declared that Allah
had forsaken them, and given them up to their foes.
</p>

<p>
"Allah never forsakes His children," said Sultána.
"As soon, O Fatima, could I desert this babe who
is dearer to me than my life's-blood.  Dost thou
not remember what our Feringhee friend told us of
the pillar of cloud and fire which guided
Beni-Israel?  When the fierce enemy pursued with his
horses and chariots, an enemy thirsting for blood,
did not that pillar stand as a wall of defence
between the weak and the strong, the faithful and
their pursuers?  The God of Israel is with us now,
and will either save or strengthen us to endure!"
</p>

<p>
Not once did the faith or the courage of the
young Afghan fail through all that terrible day.
When Sultána had owned her Saviour at baptism
she had counted the cost, she had known that she
was entering on a path which might lead to
martyrdom, following in the track of Him who had
endured it in its most terrible form.  Sultána now
cheered and encouraged her companions, and hushed
her little infant to rest with hymns of praise.
</p>

<p>
The hours passed on&mdash;how terribly slowly!  The
heat increased, every throat was parched with thirst.
Fatima crouched in one corner, moaning and weeping.
Mir Ghazan found some repose in sleep.  Ali
Khan stood with arms folded, stern and still.  He
thought of what men in like desperate circumstances
have done&mdash;how the husband has slain the wife of
his bosom, and then rushed forth to die.  But
such deeds are not for Christians; their consciences
are bound, their hands are tied&mdash;they must wait
till Allah send death to release them.  Sultána
saw her husband's stern eyes turned towards the
opening through which the wretched Denis had
passed; she read the thought which flashed through
Ali Khan's mind at that moment, before it found
expression in words.
</p>

<p>
"On one side the precipice, on the other the
foe; there the short agony&mdash;the fall&mdash;here lingering
death by thirst and starvation.  Such is the
choice now left us, and yet&mdash;we trusted in God!"
</p>

<p>
"We trust yet and will trust!" cried Sultána,
"did not the friend teach us the word, <i>Though He
slay me, yet will I trust in Him!</i>"
</p>

<p>
"Mother of Rahim!"* said Ali Khan; "thy
faith is stronger than mine.  It is well that we
have hope in heaven, on earth there is nought but despair."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* The Oriental style of addressing a woman by the name of
her child&mdash;not her own.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Nay, not despair, my lord," said the young
Eagle, her eye still bright though her wan cheek
and parched lip told of physical suffering; "a wild
fit of madness has seized the tribe.  Mustapha has
cast over them an evil spell; but the madness may
pass away and the spell be broken.  Let my lord
be assured that some true hearts are with him still.
Yar Mohammed will never forget who saved his
life when the bear was clawing his face; nor Sadik
Khan who nursed him, as a brother might, in his
sickness.  Hossein Ghazi&mdash;I could answer for his
truth; he served my father and my father's father&mdash;he
never will forsake their daughter.  Let us but
gain a little time till the first frenzy has spent its
force, and then appeal to the honour and loyalty of
our gallant Pathans.  Wot not, my lord, how our
friend would sway our fierce warriors by his powerful
words, till eyes that never before were wet,
eyes wont to look on bloodshed unmoved, were dim
with strange tears, and proud spirits were bowed
like trees when the wind sweeps past?"
</p>

<p>
"The Feringhee spake with power," said the
chief; "his words were like the bullet from a gun
aimed with skill, and sent with force&mdash;the bullet that
strikes, and down falls the deer!  <i>My</i> words are
like the bullet thrown by an unskilled hand&mdash;it
either falls short of the quarry, or if it reach it
would not ruffle a hair.  I never knew how to use
any argument but one&mdash;the strength of my own
right hand, and of that my new faith deprives me.
Ha! what is that sound! they are at us again!"
he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
Mustapha perhaps thought, like Sultána, that the
wild rage of the men whom he had seduced from
their allegiance to their brave chief, might be like
some mountain torrent, though furious quickly spent.
He would leave them small space to consider.
About two hours before sunset, when the greater
number of his followers had awoke from their
drunken slumber, Mustapha again led an assault up
the ladder.  He now applied other means to burst
open the door.  A strong ruffian, by his orders,
wielding a heavy hatchet, dealt blow after blow on
the wood.  Every thud was echoed by a faint shriek
from Mir Ghazan's terrified wife.
</p>

<p>
Ha! a portion of the wood gives way, a splinter
flies into the room, a breach is made&mdash;not large, but
wide enough to admit the muzzle of Mustapha's
pistol, and long enough to let him take aim.
</p>

<p>
"I have him now!  Dog of a renegade, die!"
exclaimed Mustapha, aiming the pistol at the
head of Ali Khan, who was not two yards'
distant.
</p>

<br>
&quot;'I have him now!  Dog of a renegade, die!' exclaimed Mustapha, <br>
aiming the pistol at the head of Ali Khan.&quot;
</p>

<p>
Sultána sprang forward, and interposed her own
form between the deadly weapon and her husband.
"Fire!" she cried, "but your bullet will only reach
the heart of a woman!"
</p>

<p>
"Give up Ali Khan! we thirst for no blood but
his!" cried the savage Mustapha.
</p>

<p>
Ali Khan himself unlocked and flung open the
door.  "Here is your chief!" he exclaimed,
manfully facing his foes.
</p>

<p>
Ali's sudden appearance somewhat startled
Mustapha, but far more was he startled by a loud
voice of command which suddenly rang through the
court-yard behind him&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"A pistol levelled at your chief! can ye behold
it, Pathans, and not strike down the villain!  Seize
him&mdash;seize the false traitor!"
</p>

<p>
The faithful Mir Ghazan dashed forward, and
seized Mustapha by the throat.  There was a brief
desperate struggle between the two men, in which
the pistol went off.  Its contents were lodged in
the brain of Mustapha.
</p>

<p>
"Shot by his own pistol&mdash;the judgment of God!"
exclaimed Walter, for it was he who had given the
order, as the bleeding corpse of Mustapha fell heavily
from the height to the ground.
</p>

<p>
"The judgment of God!" repeated many voices
with subdued awe, as if he who spake the words
was a prophet.  Walter stood amongst the wild
mountaineers as one in command.
</p>

<p>
"What is all this?" he said to the chief, who,
springing down the steps, was now warmly embracing
his deliverer.  "What has caused this mad
tumult?"
</p>

<p>
"The tribe are weary of a chief who is a
Christian," was Ali Khan's brief reply.
</p>

<p>
"The tribe!" repeated Walter.  "Not half of
them are present.  And do men without sense of
religion," he continued, looking sternly around,
"men who break the laws of him whom they call
their Prophet"&mdash;(he pointed indignantly to the
traces of the drunken revel)&mdash;"do such pretend to
zeal for their faith!"  The Moslems cowered
beneath the Englishman's glance and scathing
words.  "We will know what is indeed the will
of the tribe.  Mir Ghazan, Hossein Ghazi, summon
every man to meet us here to-morrow at sunrise;
let none be absent.  And in the meantime, remove
the corpse of that traitor."
</p>

<p>
"We'll throw it to the jackals," exclaimed Mir
Ghazan.
</p>

<p>
"No!" cried Ali Khan, "give it burial.  Christians
avenge not themselves on their enemies, be
they living or dead."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Sultána, my brave child!" exclaimed
Walter, all the sternness of his countenance softening
to an expression of paternal tenderness as he
beheld the young wife and mother, with her infant
in her arms, descending the blood-stained steps,
radiant with unspeakable delight.
</p>

<p>
"I knew that our friend would return!  I knew
that the Lord would send help!  Glory&mdash;glory to
His name!" exclaimed Sultána, the tears which
suffering could not bring, now welling from her
beautiful eyes.
</p>

<p>
If anything dashed the joy which the missionary
experienced at that moment, it was a feeling of
self-reproach and shame that he had so hesitatingly,
doubtingly, gloomily followed the pillar which had
led him back to the Afghan mountains,&mdash;nay, that
he had all but given up following its guidance.
Had his return been delayed for but one day
longer&mdash;one hour&mdash;nay, five minutes, he would have
arrived too late.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII.
<br><br>
WHERE THE PILLAR RESTED.
</h3>

<p>
The fort, as has been mentioned, was by no
means the dwelling-place of all the members
of Ali Khan's tribe; though, their numbers
being small, in times of danger all would seek
refuge within its walls.  There were rude hamlets
scattered here and there in the mountains, as well
as some huts clustered in a little valley below.
From every tenement ere sunrise on the following
day come the Pathans in answer to Walter's
summons.  At dawn the court-yard, with its recesses,
was crowded; the mountaineers' manly forms,
picturesque attire, and the various emotions
expressed on their swarthy countenances, giving great
interest and animation to the scene.
</p>

<p>
Ali Khan, with Walter on his right hand, stood
on the narrow landing-place at the top of the
ladder-staircase; this served as an elevated platform from
which to address the people.  Sultána, in the room
behind, was an eager listener to all that passed.
</p>

<p>
"Ali Khan, brave chief, it is for you to speak to
your tribe," said Walter.
</p>

<p>
"I never could speak in my life," said the Afghan
bluntly.  "You know my heart&mdash;you will be as my tongue."
</p>

<p>
"Nay, a few words from yourself will be needful."
</p>

<p>
Ali Khan was not the first gallant warrior who
has shrunk from the effort of making a speech;
however, after the pause of a few seconds, with
manly frankness thus he spake:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Afghan brothers! we have been born amongst
you, lived amongst you, and I had thought to stay
amongst you to the end; but if you do not wish
me for your chief, I tell you that I will only rule
over free men, not over unwilling slaves.  The
world is wide&mdash;so is God's grace.  We can seek for
graves elsewhere.  We will go, carrying with us
our Christian faith, and leaving behind&mdash;our
forgiveness."
</p>

<p>
Short was the speech; but it had its effect on the
throng, who had listened with profound attention.
Sultána felt proud of her husband's eloquence, and
looked fondly into the face of her boy, discovering
in his baby features a likeness to his brave father.
</p>

<p>
"Now it is your turn," said Ali Khan to Walter
Gurney, who thus addressed the listening crowd:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Afghans&mdash;friends (may I not call you so, for
albeit of another race I am willing to cast in my lot
with you all)&mdash;you are assembled on an important
occasion, to decide upon who is to be the chief who
shall henceforth be at the head of your tribe.  For
more than two years you have been under the rule
of Ali Khan; you know him well, he has been
amongst you from childhood.  Is there any man
here who has sustained wrong at the hands of the
chief; is there one who has been oppressed, or
robbed, or tortured?  If there be one who has just
cause to complain of the Christian Ali Khan, let
that man now lift up his hand."
</p>

<p>
There was no movement in answer to the appeal.
</p>

<p>
"It then follows," continued Walter, after a
pause, "that you own that Christianity makes a
man neither tyrannical nor unjust; it does not make
him unfaithful to his engagements, nor neglectful
of the cries of the poor.  Brothers! ye have listened
to the words of your chief, and what I say now I
say as his spokesman.  It is the desire of Ali Khan
that I set two alternatives before you.  If you, as
Moslems, find that you cannot endure the leadership
of a Christian, Ali Khan will make no struggle,
shed no blood to maintain his right; he and his
family will quit a land which rejects so brave and
true a son.  I have enough influence to procure
honourable employment in India for my brother and
friend."  (Here a dissentient murmur was heard from
the crowd below, but no distinctly audible words.)  "If,
on the other hand, you wish to keep amongst
you as leader the best and bravest man of your
tribe, who asks but that toleration for his religion
which he accords to that of others, Ali Khan is
willing to forgive the past, to forget that his Pathans
ever wavered in their loyalty to their chief.  My
own connection with the English will enable us to
open up commerce, to procure for you advantages
not possessed by tribes more remote from the frontier.
The two countries, as you know, are now at peace;
the scimitar of war is sheathed, the Afghan trader
is welcomed if he descend into the plain."  (There was
again a murmur, but not this time of dissatisfaction.)  "If
I remain here, I tell you frankly, it will
be as a missionary, a spiritual guide; but Christianity,
unlike Islam, makes no converts by the sword.
No man's freedom of conscience shall be violated;
ye shall listen to my teaching or turn away as ye
will.  I come to you, O Afghans! as one who, having
found a treasure, seeks to share it with others;
as one who, having slaked his thirst at a fountain,
would call his thirsty, weary brethren to come and
drink also.  And now, Afghans, I put to you the
question, on your answer to which will depend
whether we remain amongst you, or quit these
Afghanistan mountains&mdash;perhaps for ever.  Are ye
willing to retain and to obey Ali Khan as your
chief?"
</p>

<p>
Out flashed many a bright scimitar, weapons
were waved on high; if there were any dissentient
voices they were drowned in the almost universal
shout of "Long live Ali Khan!  Prosperity to our
brave chief!  We will stand by him to the death!"
</p>

<p>
While Ali Khan responded to the tumultuous
acclamations of his followers, Walter turned and
entered the room in which he had left Sultána.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, God-sent friend!" she exclaimed, clasping
her hands, "you will remain with us&mdash;teach
us&mdash;guide us&mdash;show us the way to heaven!"
</p>

<p>
"If the Lord will," replied Walter Gurney, "I
am ready to live and to die in the Eagle's Nest."
</p>

<p class="t3">
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The world would deem the resolution that of a
mad enthusiast, carried away by the excitement of
the moment.  What! should one before whom was
opening a brilliant career, with wealth, fame,
friendship, love to beckon him on, give up all for what
that world would deem a mere philanthropical
dream!  Could the brilliant genius find no better
employment for his talents than teaching ignorant
savages, who might at the last reward his labours
by taking his life?  Were all the comforts, the
luxuries of refined civilisation, to be exchanged for
exile amongst the mountains, with hardships to be
endured, and perhaps a martyr's obscure grave to
be filled at the end!  "Strange folly!" the world
would exclaim, "to give up all that man holds
precious, with nothing to weigh in the balance
against it!"
</p>

<p>
<i>Nothing</i>!  Oh, how different the calculations of
angels!  In the balances of heaven what would the
crown of a Cæsar weigh against one immortal soul?
Did not the Son of God think it worth while to
leave heaven itself to win it?  Let me quote the
words of the missionary Duff&mdash;more powerful than
any that I can pen: "This great and mighty Being
did for our sakes consent to veil His glory and
appear upon earth as a Man of Sorrows, whose
visage was so marred,&mdash;more than any man's,&mdash;and
His form more than the sons of men.  Oh! is not
this love, self-sacrificing love, condescension
without a parallel and without a name!  God manifest
in the flesh!  God manifest for the redemption of
a rebel race!  Oh! is not this the wonder of the
world; is not this the astonishment of a universe!"  Referring
to the angels, the missionary continues:
"Tell me, oh, tell me, if in their cloudless vision it
would seem aught so marvellous, so passing strange,
did they behold the greatest and mightiest of a
guilty race, redeemed themselves at so vast a price,
... issue forth in the footsteps of the Divine
Redeemer into the waste and howling wilderness of
sin, to seek and to save them that are lost!"
</p>

<p>
One more word to the reader ere we part.  It
may be not to you, O my brother or sister, that
the call is given to leave your country to carry the
message of salvation to the heathen; for you the
pillar of cloud and fire may rest over some Elam;
God may bid you watch over an aged parent, make
a home happy, bring up children for Him.  Your
work may be in Scotch or English parish; perhaps
in the crowded city, perhaps in the peaceful village.
But is your eye fixed on that pillar, the emblem of
the will of your Heavenly King?  Is the calm
peaceful resolution of your heart, "<i>Wherever</i> Thou
wilt, <i>however</i> Thou wilt, O my adorable Lord! but
guide me, and I will follow!"  Then blessed is
your path, whether in wilderness or green pastures,
whether through roaring billows or beside the still
waters!  Dispensing blessings to the poor around,
teaching the ignorant, comforting the afflicted,
fighting against the power of Satan both within
and without, you may be as truly serving the Lord,
as truly pressing forward to the prize, as if
planting the banner of the Cross on the height of
some
